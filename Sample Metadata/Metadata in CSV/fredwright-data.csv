Labor History - 1: The First Strike,Fred Wright,James Lerner,"Strikes, Average Work Day",Strikes and lockouts--United States.; Work environment--United States.; Labor unions--United States--History--18th century.; Hours of labor--United States.,"This cartoon depicts the first strike in 1786 by the Philadelphia printers in response to low wages and long hours. Caption 1:  Relief from British oppression as a result of the American revolution did not bring relief from terribly long hours and equally short pay to American working men. Typical was the condition of New York workers who were paid 25 cents to 50 cents a day in 1789 for days running from ""sunup to sundown."" Since they paid by the day, employers preferred to have their men work in the seasons when the days were longest and to lay them off at other times. ""Many of our small tradesmen, cartmen, day laborers and others dwell upon the borders of poverty,"" commented the Daily Advertiser at the time.  Caption 2:  There were strikes before there were unions as conditions became unbearable. Among the first to engage in strikes were the New York printers, who in 1778, demanded ""an addition of three dollars per week to our present small pittance."" They won this without having to strike. But in 1786 their Philadelphia brothers made history with the first recorded strike for ""a dollar a day"" or six dollars a week. ""We will support such of our brethren,"" they resolved, ""as shall be thrown out of employment on account of their refusing to work for less than $6 a week."" The ""turnout,"" as it was called, was successful.  Caption 3:  Philadelphia house carpenters lost a strike for a 10-hour day. Baltimore sailors and New York carpenters were among those who struck in the next few years. None of these resulted in permanent organization. Workers disbanded the organizations as soon as the battle for the immediate demand was over. In some cases workers tried to use their mutual aid societies as substitutes for unions as we know them. But when state legislatures passed laws forbidding this practice, unions were formed. Philadelphia shoemakers set up the first local craft union in 1792. It lasted one year.

Labor History - 2: The First Closed Shop,Fred Wright,James Lerner,Union Organization,Labor unions--United States--History--18th century.; Open and closed shop--United States.,"This cartoon depicts early agreements of secrecy among union members and the development of the first closed shop in 1805. Caption 1:  Earliest union members took an oath to keep proceedings of their meetings secret, not to work under the union wage scale and to help other members get jobs. Some fined members for not attending meetings. First absence cost 10 to 12 cents, next 20 to 25 cents, and third 50 cents. Members could be tossed out for getting drunk too often, or for immorality. Such rules governed the N'.Y'. Typographical Society and the N. Y. Cordwainers (shoemakers).  Caption 2:  Agreement to stand by the union wage scale was followed in 1802 by unions selecting committees to present wage scales to employers. Any boss who refused to agree might find himself picketed by a ""tramping committee."" In 1799 Philadelphia shoemakers won a trade-wide agreement. To stop runaways to non-union areas, the New York printers tried to get a union wage scale for the entire east in 1815, but the employers refused.  Caption 3:  First closed shop came out of Cordwainers' agreement in 1805 that no member would work for an employer who hired anyone ""that does not belong to this society, unless the journeyman come and join the same."" Violation brought one dollar fine and if not corrected, expulsion. ""If I didn't join,"" one complained, ""no man would sit upon the seat where I worked, nor board nor lodge in the same house, nor would they work at all for the same employer.

Labor History - 3:  Scabs of Old,Fred Wright,James Lerner,Scabs,Strikebreakers--United States.; Labor unions--United States--History--18th century.,"This cartoon depicts the use of scabs dating back to the early 1800s, highlighting the contempt that existed between union workers and scabs. Caption 1:  One of the oldest and the most dishonorable title in American labor history is ""scab."" Striking New York seamen marched to the waterfront behind drum and fife in 1800 to battle with scabs. ""A scab is a shelter for lice"" shouted a cordwainer (shoemaker) in a New York courtroom a few years later and was fined $5 for contempt of court.  Caption 2:  Taking the place of a union printer who had been fired for refusing to work beneath the union scale would result in expulsion from the N.Y. Typographical Union in the early 1800's. This was considered scabbing and lists of scabs were exchanged by the unions in different cities even though they were not yet affiliated to any national organization.  Caption 3:  When Philadelphia currier (leather tanner) bosses advertised for scabs in other cities in 1803, the union ran a newspaper ad urging ""that their brethren of the trade will take no notice of any advertisements of the employers...more especially as the master curriers have entered into resolutions to lower the prices that have been current for 20 years past.""

Labor History - 4: Conspiracy to Raise Wages,Fred Wright,James Lerner,"Union Organization, Businesses",Shoemakers--Labor unions--Pennsylvania--Philadelphia.; Labor unions--Pennsylvania--Philadelphia--History.; Wages--Shoemakers--Pennsylvania--Philadelphia.; Labor unions--United States--History--19th century.,"This cartoon depicts businesses' early attempts at outlawing unions by charging them in court with a conspiracy to raise wages. Caption 1:  With union organizations leading to higher wages (a painter's daily wage in Massachusetts was $1.15 in 1800) employers moved to outlaw them. Eight Philadelphia shoe workers were charged, in 1805, with forming ""a combination and conspiracy to raise wages"" through the Cordwainers Union. The prosecution argued that one worker could legally seek a wage increase but that it was illegal for two or more, to do so.  Caption 2:  Merchants, innkeepers, master tailors were among the jury and labor spy Job Harrison a chief witness. Among prosecution arguments were that industry would leave Philadelphia if the union continued; that the unions were made up of men ""who have been only a little time in your country"" and were already trying to change its laws. Witnesses were found to claim that union members had threatened their lives.  Caption 3:  Defense Attorney Rodney said neither the public's welfare nor patriotism was the issue, but employers' profit. Many employers attended the trial. The men were found guilty of trying to raise wages. The fine was small, eight dollars each, but the heavy costs incurred broke the organization; it had to disband. In the next years similar trials were held in Pittsburgh, New York and Baltimore. Tough times were ahead.

Labor History - 5: Shorter Work Day Demanded,Fred Wright,James Lerner,"Union Organization, Economy",Hours of labor--United States.; Labor unions--Organizing--United States.; Labor unions--United States--History--19th century.,"This cartoon depicts the dissolution and reemergence of union activities between 1819 and 1823, resulting in the beginning of the American labor movement.  The UE News originally ran this cartoon with the title, ""The First United Movement."" Caption 1:  As unions in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, New York were hit by conspiracy charges for trying to raise wages, organization slowed down. Weakened as they were, the unions could not withstand the depression that hit in 1819. Members could not fight for higher wages and shorter hours. A New York printer wrote: ""We lived eight days without tea, sugar, or meat--on bread and butter only with cold water.""  Caption 2:  Things got so bad organization had to begin again. New Orleans printers complained (in 1823) that they were ""not receiving regular pay from their employers."" They set up a union. A year later came the first recorded strike of women workers. These were the weavers at Pawtucket, R.I. The National Gazette wrote of their meeting: ""It was conducted . . . without noise, or scarcely a single speech.""  Caption 3:  Unions were springing up in many trades. By 1827 workers saw that they could no longer remain separated. Philadelphia labor set up the country's first city central body--the Mechanics Union of Trade Associations. This is regarded as the real beginning of the American labor movement. The big issue that united the unions was the demand for a 10-hour day. The shorter work day was to unite labor frequently in later years.

Labor History - 5B: Labor Enters Politics,Fred Wright,James Lerner,"Politics and Legislation, Average Work Day",Labor unions--United States--Political activity.; Hours of labor--United States.; Working class-United States--Political activity.; Labor unions--United States--History--19th century.,"This cartoon depicts the beginning of labor's foray into politics as they began naming their own candidates in response to the worsening work conditions. Caption 1:  Stressing the need for a 10-hour day, Philadelphia's Mechanics Union of Trade Associations soon made political action its major undertaking. The country's first central body of unions urged its affiliated unions in 1827 to declare how they stood on nominating candidates to ""represent the interest of the working class"" in city and state legislative elections. Within a few years the idea of workingmen's parties spread to other Pennsylvania towns, New York State, through New England into at least a dozen states.  Caption 2:  Labor's parties were naming their own candidates and sometimes electing them. One paper described the situation in this way: ""From Maine to Georgia, within a few months past we discern symptoms of a revolution, which will be second to none save that of '76."" Labor began putting out its own newspapers such as Philadelphia's Mechanics' Free Press, first of its kind.  Caption 3:  Political action was labor's answer to worsening conditions. Summer work schedules ran from 4 a.m. to sunset with an hour off for lunch at 10 and another for dinner at 3 p.m. Representation in government and free public education were major demands. Both political parties were condemned as spokesmen for the rich. Another labor demand was abolition of imprisonment for debt.

Labor History - 6: Labor Enters Politics,Fred Wright,James Lerner,Politics and Legislation,Labor unions--United States--Political activity.; Working class--United States--Political activity.; Labor unions--United States--History--19th century.,"This cartoon depicts the varying successes and failures of workingmen's parties in New York and Massachusetts in the 1830s. Caption 1:  With conditions and wages getting worse, labor in the late 1820's put greater emphasis on political action. Workingmen formed their own local parties and gave heavy support to Andrew Jackson, the successful candidate for president in 1828. The new Whig party objected to ""throwing the polls open to every man that walks"" as it fought Jacksonian democracy. A  New York mechanics' meeting formed a party after protesting against attempts to lengthen the 10-hour day.  Caption 2:  New York's workingmen's party ran its first candidates in 1829. Of 21,000 votes cast it drew 6,000. Newspapers had blasted the new party as the ""Infidel Ticket"". Its women's leader, Frances Wright, was denounced as insane and atheistic. The election of carpenter Ebenezer Ford to the assembly was called a disgrace which would scare traders and investors from the city.  Caption 3:  Elsewhere, at Salina, N. Y., the Farmers and Mechanics' Party swept the 1839 election. The Working Men's Party of Massachusetts gained control of ten towns in 1833. Labor's parties didn't last long, however. Some workers thought they should stick to trade unions. Others saw it more important to back the Jacksonian movement. Many were frightened away by the attacks on the parties as ""radical"".

Labor History - 7: Women Form Unions,Fred Wright,James Lerner,Union Organization,United States--Economic conditons--19th century.; Women labor union members--United States.; Labor unions--United States--Political activity.; Labor unions--United States--History--19th century.,"As cost of living went up in the mid 1830s, women entered the workforce.  This cartoon depicts their contribution to labor and the formation of their own unions. Caption 1:  Workingmen were the strongest supporters of Andrew Jackson for his first term and then for the re-election seeing in him the fighter against the banks and their employers. Trade unions were spreading very rapidly especially as the nation experienced a runaway inflation. ""The barbers have struck,"" a horrified N.Y.Times wrote in April, 1836, ""and now all that remains for Editors is to strike, too.""  Caption 2:  In two years, 1834-1836, the cost of living jumped 66 percent. Young boys were brought in to industry to undercut workers' wages. Women were hired as printers, cigar makers as well as tailors and shoemakers. They were paid $1.25 a week and glad to get it as the high prices made it impossible for their families to get along. Even convicts were put to work competing with free labor.  Caption 3:  Many unions which had been broken up through courts, red-baiting (they had that, then, too) and blacklists revived. Baltimore women formed the United Seamstresses Society; New Yorkers, the Ladies' Shoebinders and Female Book-binders. In Philadelphia, the Female Improvement Society and the growth of the New England textile industry was accompanied by the Female Society of Lynn and Vicinity for the Protection and Promotion of Female Industry.

Labor History - 8: Women's Union Strikes,Fred Wright,James Lerner,Strikes, Women labor union members--United States.; Strikes and lockouts--United States.; Labor unions--United States--History--19th century.,"This cartoon depicts several strikes by women's unions in the 1830s. Caption 1:  Unions sprang UP all over the east coast and as far as St. Louis between 1833-37. More than 150 of them were set up in New York, Philadelphia, Boston. There were 168 strikes in that time. Of special note were the activities of the ""Ladies Unions."" At Dover, N.H., 700 girls struck; at Lowell, Mass., a 15% wage cut led to 800 girls striking in 1834. They lost. Two years later wages were cut 12% and they were out again.  Caption 2:  Forming a factory girls assn., with 2,500 members, these Lowell workers marched through the streets singing: Oh, isn't it a pity that such a pretty girl as I, Should be sent to the factory to pine away and die? Oh! I cannot be a slave! I will not be a slave. For I'm so fond of liberty, That I cannot be a slave.  Caption 3:  They were thrown out of the boarding houses, starved into surrender. Ordered to tend two looms, Amesbury girls stopped work and pledged ""under a forfeit of five dollars"" not to go back to work until the speed-up was dropped. They won. While some men objected to women's union activities, others held that ""unless we have the female sex on our side, we cannot hope to accomplish any object we have in view.""

Labor History - 9: Children Strike,Fred Wright,James Lerner,"Average Work Day, Strikes",Child labor--United States.; Labor unions--Organizing--United States.; Hours of labor--United States.; Strikes and lockouts--United States.; Labor unions--United States--History--19th century.,"This cartoon depicts strikes held by children and their parents demanding a shorter work day, resulting in resistance from their employers. Caption 1:  The demand for a shorter work-day was sweeping the east in the 1830's following the defeat of the workers on this issue a decade earlier. Children working in the Paterson, N.J. textile mills struck on July 3, 1833 for an 11-hour day and 9 hours on Saturday. Their parents formed the ""Paterson Association for the Protection of the Working Classes of Paterson."" Financial aid came from nearby cities. The kids held out until victory.  Caption 2:  Employers responded with charges that it was ""bands of Irish and other foreigners,"" ""elements of disorder"" who were responsible for the shorter work-day demand. Newspapers warned that to be idle several hours of the morning would lead workers to drunkenness and ruin. Employers resisted the 10-hour day as much as they did the 8-hour day 50 years later.  Caption 3:  Resolving to work for a 10-hour day, Philadelphia carpenters said all men had the right ""to have sufficient time for the cultivation of their mind and self-improvement."" Boston strikers declared that a longer day exhausted the mechanic's physical and mental powers. It was a sign of labor's maturity to demand greater educational opportunities, and free schooling for their children--they tied the shorter work day to the ""cultivation of the mind.""

Labor History - 10: Two Cents an Hour,Fred Wright,James Lerner,"Average Work Day, Politics and Legislation",Hours of labor--United States.; Labor unions--United States--History--19th century.; Labor unions--United States--Periodicals.,"This cartoon depicts the first declaration of the 10-hour day for government projects and the fight against this by private businesses.  Out of this, both employers and workers created labor newspapers. Caption 1:  Labor's movement for a shorter work day (shorter than 12 hours) in the 1840's had its first big victory with the declaration by Pres. Martin Van Buren setting a 10-hour day on all government projects. But private employers fought hard to stop the movement. New York leather curriers and dealers agreed not to hire anyone known to be a member of a society which would set ""the direction of terms or prices for which workmen shall engage themselves."" Among the weapons workers developed then was the first labor press.  Caption 2:  Employers had been sponsoring papers which printed such propaganda as the ""Song of the Factory Girl"" in New England: ""Oh. sing me the song of the Factory Girl! So merry and glad and free! The bloom in her cheeks, of health how it speaks. Oh, happy a creature is she! She tends the loom, she watches the spindle, And cheerfully toileth away, And her bosom is very gay.""  Caption 3:  To combat this kind of ""Works News"" girls working in New England mills started what is thought to be the first labor papers. In New Hampshire they set up in 1842, The Factory Girl. Then came the weekly Voice of Industry in Lowell, Mass. Writing to this paper a girl complained of working from 6 a.m. until 10 p.m. for $1.56 a week. ""Here am I, a healthy New England girl, quite well behaved, bestowing just half of all my hours, including Sundays, upon a company for less than 2 cents an hour.""

Labor History - 11: Large Scale Immigration,Fred Wright,James Lerner,"Average Work Day, Economy",Industrial revolution--United States.; Alien labor--United States.; Wages--United States.; Labor unions--United States--History--19th century.,"In the mid 1800s, labor suffered setbacks due to increases in the use of machinery and large scale immigration.  Wages dropped dramatically, affecting the lives of many workers and immigrants. Caption 1:  Machinery was rapidly taking over from hand production in the 1840's. The shoemakers (Lynn, Mass.) who had their little shops in season and could dig clams out of season were being swallowed by factories; power looms displaced hand-loom weavers; power presses replaced hand printing. This was accompanied by severe earning slashes. Hatters pay, for example, dropped from $12 to $8 a week between 1835 and 1845.  Caption 2:  Millions of immigrants were arriving. Only one million had come in the first 50 years of the nation; from 1846 to 1855 about three million came. They were refugees from famines as in Ireland; from suppressed revolutions as in Germany. Employers took advantage of this to provide themselves with cheap labor. An 1850 budget said about $11 a week was the minimum needed for a N.Y. family. Average weekly earnings were $1 a person.  Caption 3:  Slums grew in this misery. N.Y. had 18,000 living in cellars; from 6 to 20 persons in a single room. A Boston study (1849) told of people ""huddled together like brutes..."" sometimes wife, husband, brothers and sisters in the same beds."" A tremendous protest movement for a shorter work day, for decent living conditions was growing. Refugees from unsuccessful European revolutions responded eagerly to native leaders who sought to curb capital's greed.

Labor History - 12: Ten Hour Day,Fred Wright,James Lerner,"Average Work Day, Politics and Legislation, Businesses",Hours of labor--United States.; Labor laws and legislation--United States.; Labor unions--United States--History--19th century.,"This cartoon depicts labor's victory in gaining the 10-hour work day through various state legislations.  Employers, however, resisted this by blacklisting workers who would not work the longer hours. Caption 1:  Defeated time and again workers kept returning to the demand for a 10-hour day to ease their hardships and enable them to get needed leisure time for recreation and education. A meeting of New Jersey workingmen resolved that ""we hold the doctrine that masses were created to toil and the few to think in abhorrence"" (1847). And in Nashville, Tenn. carpenters declared: ""We are flesh and blood, we need hours for recreation.""  Caption 2:  To some legislation was the only way to cut hours. Others thought arrangements with individual employers the answer. Then there were those who proposed a general strike hroughout New England starting on July 4. Meanwhile New Hampshire passed a state 10-hour law (1847). Pennsylvania followed a year later and other states followed a few years later. But the laws did not stop employers from blacklisting any who wouldn't work longer hours.  Caption 3:  To this employers answered as did a Chicopee, Mass. mill manager: ""It is not the hours per day that a person works that breaks him down, but the hours spent in dissipation."" He saw shorter hours as reducing wages and increasing dissipation. Even among workers some felt that they could get a shorter day only with a reduction in earnings. But others felt that reducing hours would result in a greater demand for labor and therefore higher wages.

In this cartoon Wright depicts a three month strike in Western Pennsylvania, which resulted in a 10-hour day. Caption 1:  Western Pennsylvania employers insisted that workers sign contracts agreeing to a 12-hour day although the law set a 10-hour limit. Strikes broke out and when one factory reopened with scabs after three weeks, women strikers, armed with axes, marched on the plant, broke down the gates, overpowered the police and captured the plant. The scabs left but many strikers were arrested and sentenced to jail.  Caption 2:  The strike, lasting from July to September, ended with a 10-hour day established but with a wage cut. The workers did not rest, however, until they had won back the 12-hour pay. Elsewhere, too, workers were relying on their economic strength to win this demand. In 1853, the workers of Media, Pa. signed a contract with all employers for a 10-hour day. They then sent two of their members to spread unionism in New England.  Caption 3:  Meanwhile, groups of workers were holding conventions for the 10-hour day, such as the 1852 Massachusetts state convention. Candidates were asked where they stood on the issue and that year the elections had this as the only issue as politicians were forced to bow to the demand. Public petitions were circulated but still nothing happened as corporations bought influence in the legislature.

Labor History - 14: Ten Hour Day III,Fred Wright,James Lerner,"Politics and Legislation, Average Work Day",Hours of labor--United States.; Working class--United States--Political activity.; Labor unions--United States--History--19th century.,"This cartoon depicts the spread of the 10-hour day through legislation in various states such as New Jersey and Ohio, resulting from pressure on state legislatures. Caption 1:  The 12-hour day was being whittled away slowly in the late 1840's. At Trenton, N.J. the ""Friends of the 10-Hour System"" came into being in 1848. At public meetings, through political action and strikes this was made the major issue. The Democratic Party was persuaded to nominate shoemaker Charles Skelton for Congress in 1851 on a 10-hour day platform. He was elected.  Caption 2:  Pressure on the N.J. state legislature by the Trenton Workingmen's Assn. resulted in passage of a state law the same year setting 10-hours as the normal work day. By the beginning of the Civil War (1861) the 10-hour day had been won for skilled mechanics but most factory workers still labored 11 or more hours. It had taken 30 years of hard work to cut the average work day from 12 1/2 hours.  Caption 3:  During those years Pennsylvania set 12 years of age as the minimum starting age for working in commercial jobs (1848). Ohio came through with a 10-hour day limit for working women. The employers were tough. They held firmly to every minute of labor but while the fight was hard, it was uniting workers and laying the basis for the country's first national unions.

"Labor History - 15: The ""English Conspiracy""",Fred Wright,James Lerner,"Economy, Average Work Day, Strikes",United States--Economic conditons--19th century.; Strikes and lockouts--United States.; Wages--United States.; Labor unions--United States--History--19th century.,"This cartoon shows how as living costs rose in the 1850s and wages remained low, workers began striking.  The press wrote that the strikes were part of an international conspiracy starting in England. Caption 1:  Living costs rose rapidly in the 1850's; wages couldn't keep up. The discovery of gold in California spurred rising costs as huge amounts of money came into the market. It took at least $10.57 to support a family of five for a week in New York in 1851. But daily earnings ranged from 89 cents for blacksmiths to a top of $2 for stone cutters with most skilled men earning far below the top. A woman who earned over $2 was unusual.  Caption 2:  Alongside of these low wages were most miserable living conditions. Unskilled New England workers, for example, lived in unheated shacks with the open door as the only source of light. Editor Horace Greeley (""Go West, Young Man"") commented that workers had no money for  amusements, for a doctor or apothecary, for pew rent in church, for ice cream or books. There was an urgent need for union organization which had been smashed a decade earlier.  Caption 3:  A new wave of strikes broke out. In four years (1850-1854) skilled mechanics won a 25 percent wage increase. Some daily papers charged the strikes as being an international conspiracy which had ""commenced in England"" with the aim of overthrowing government and private property. Others wrote (Trenton Daily Gazette) ""Men should always have a fair compensation for their labor."" From these strikes appeared the first national labor unions.

Labor History - 16: First National Unions,Fred Wright,James Lerner,"Union Organization, Economy",Labor unions--Organizing--United States.; Alien labor--United States.; Women labor union members--United States.; Labor unions--United States--History--19th century.,"This cartoon depicts the first formation of national unions in the 1850s until the depression of 1854 and crisis of 1877 broke them. Caption 1:  From the small local unions of the 1850's there began appearing the first national unions. Among these were the Typographical Union, Molders' Union and Blacksmiths. They were craft unions as was all of the union movement. The organizations didn't last long as the 1854 depression and then the 1857 crisis broke them.  Caption 2:  The unions barred unskilled and a number of them including printers, waiters, shoemakers and tailors also excluded women. Some of the unions learned, however, that this did not help labor as when Cleveland tailors struck only to find employers hiring non-union women tailors to work at lower wages. The union then admitted women.  Caption 3:  Employers were also using the arrival of millions of European immigrants to divide labor. Propagandists blamed foreign born workers for lowering wages by saying they were willing to wear rags and ""feed upon the coarsest, cheapest and roughest fare."" Employer agents would board ships to hire workers at $20 or $30 a year and board.

Caption 1:  The sprouting labor movement --national and local-- came to a halt when the panic of 1857 swept the country. Newspapers reported that every ship leaving for Europe was crowded with foreign born workers returning home. Those who remained behind joined native born Americans in demand for relief from starvation. Philadelphia German workers formed an association with this aim in view.  Caption 2:  Other parts of the east were swept by huge demonstrations of unemployed seeking ""work or bread."" Addressing a crowd of 12,000 in New York, carpenter John H. Paul denounced ""the capitalists"" as ""this crew of thieves and robbers who are driving us to starvation...Let there be an organization formed in every ward at once; let us set aside all political and religious considerations.""  Caption 3:  U.S. troops were called out in November, 1857, when 15,000 New Yorkers marched on Wall Street shouting ""we want work."" Some broke into shops of flour merchants to help themselves. The unemployed were denounced as ""ultra-communist radicals...and other foreigners, who though they have changed their soil and allegiance, still keep their nature intact and insist upon having food put in their mouths and labor into their hands.""

Labor History - 18: Lynn Shoemakers' Strike - I,Fred Wright,James Lerner,Strikes,Strikes and lockouts--Footwear industry--Massachusetts--Lynn.; Shoemakers--Massachusetts--Lynn.; Labor unions--United States--History--19th century.,"This cartoon depicts the Lynn Shoemaker's strike of 1860, which was in response to wage cuts after the panic of 1857. Caption 1:  As the unemployed began returning to their jobs after the panic of 1857, they found that employers had cut their wages. Strikes began breaking out. The Grand Association of Pennsylvania called a general strike in Feb., 1859 which was won although ""the bosses"" as a newspaper wrote, ""tried to divide the strikers by embittering the minds of the Germans against the Irish, and the Americans against the Irish.""  Caption 2:  But it was the New England Shoemakers' strike of 1859 which set a new mark for labor action. Their wages reduced to $3 a week, ($1 for women) and days as long as 16 hours, the workers could no longer stand it. After mass meetings to consider demands, the Lynn Mechanics Assn. wrote all manufacturers telling them of a new wage scale and asking for a meeting to consider it. The employers refused to meet.  Caption 3:  Washington's birthday, 1860, was chosen for the strike date because ""it is a fitting occasion for a blow in favor of the cause you are engaged in..."" Three thousand shoemakers met at Lynn Lyceum Hall to set up a committee of 100 to prevent  expressmen from taking unfinished shoes out of the plants. A second committee was formed to visit shops to make sure no one scabbed; a third to help keep order.

Caption 1:  From the 3,000 Lynn Shoemakers on strike, groups fanned out in 1860 to get support throughout New England. In a few days Mechanics' Associations had been set up in 25 towns and about 20,000 shoeworkers in Mass., New Hampshire and Maine were out against $3-a-week wages. To the newspapers this was ""Revolution at the North."" ""The Rebellion Among the Workmen, Beginning of the Conflict Between Capital and Labor.""  Caption 2:  Weekly wages for women were as low as $1. They were compared to the ""amiable females"" of the French Revolution. Parading in Marblehead they carried such signs as ""American Ladies Will Not Be Slaves,"" ""Weak in Physical Strength But Strong in Moral Courage."" Lynn employers persuaded the mayor to call out the light infantry and import Boston police. 800 people massed at the railroad station to denounce the invaders.  Caption 3:  Attempts to line up Germans and Irish to scab failed; so did appeals for Negro scabs. A Negro minister told his congregation: ""You, my colored brethren, know how to sympathize with labor unrequited."" Many employers agreed to settle but not to recognize the union. Some strikers returned with a 10 percent raise and no contract. Others got signed agreements. After about six weeks the strike was called off and the basis laid for permanent organization.

Labor History - 20: Slavery the Issue,Fred Wright,James Lerner,"War, Economy",Slavery--Southern States.; Labor unions--United States--History--19th century.,"This cartoon depicts the years leading up to the Civil War when white southern workers began to fight slavery.  Slavery not only affect black slaves, but also depressed wages in the entire region for all workers. Caption 1:  Slavery brought not only misery to the Negroes but helped keep southern white wages at the lowest in the nation. Georgia cotton workers in 1860 were paid $7.39 a month, for work Massachusetts mill workers were being paid $14.57. In many factories white southern workers were pitted against Negro slaves--with the cost of keeping a slave 72 cents a day. And white workers often fought against the slaves being hired.  Caption 2:  Gradually many of the southern whites began to see that they'd be much more sensible if they stopped fighting the victims--the slaves--and started fighting the cause--slavery. At Lexington, Ky., mechanics resolved that ""the institution of slavery is alike...injurious to the slaveholder and non-slaveholder...that it degrades labor...public and private right require its ultimate extinction.""  Caption 3:  In many parts of the South the years just before the Civil War saw whites standing with the slaves against the slave owners. An Alabama paper wrote of slaves who are ""associating with low white people who are not slave owners. Such people,"" it complained, ""are dangerous to the community."" A Texas paper (1856) wrote of ""white men who are constantly inciting our slaves to deeds of violence and bloodshed.""

Caption 1:  Working people were of many minds about slavery. Some feared competition of freed slaves. Others held that ""wage slavery"" should be the real concern. Avoidance of war at any cost was the desire of many. But in the years just  before the Civil War, the threat of slavery moving into free territory took top-most position. Economic competition of slaves and control of the government by slaveowners moved labor into the anti-slavery camp.  Caption 2:  Labor went for Lincoln in the 1860 election. He had come out for a ""system of labor...under which laborers can strike."" He had recognized the truth that ""capital is the fruit of labor, and could not have existed if labor had not first existed..."" He was for assuring that slavery would not be spread to undermine free workers' wages. Large numbers of foreign born workers were for him because he opposed bigotry.  Caption 3:  Secession of the southern states destroyed any lukewarm feelings about slavery that had existed among northern labor. Appeals for volunteers by Lincoln were answered in great numbers. Parades, mass meetings swept the country. Some unions dissolved as all members enlisted in the army. ""I having been resolved"" said one such, ""to enlist with Uncle Sam for the war, this union stands adjourned until either the Union is safe or we are whipped.""

Caption 1:  Support for the union grew to such heights among workers that before the Civil War was over close to half of the northern armies were made up of working people, a far greater proportion than workers in the country. Some legions were made up almost entirely of workers in single industries like lumbermen of Wisconsin, mechanics of Lowell, Mass. Then there were workingmen's nationality legions like the New York Polish Legion and the Irish Company.  Caption 2:  One Lowell group was analyzed as consisting of 60 workers; 22 farmers, 3 merchants, 2 students and one gentleman. The Brooklyn Painters Union voted to fight as a unit. Local 23 of the Wisconsin Typographical Union had to dissolve because its members had volunteered. From first being interested mainly in preserving the United States, most of labor came to see the necessity of fighting to end slavery.  Caption 3:  Slaveowners boasted that slaves in southern factories and cotton fields, would release manpower for the south to win. Northern labor saw that freedom for the slaves was vital to destroy the southern manpower reserve. One paper wrote: ""The slavery of the black man leads to the slavery of the white man... .If it is true, that 'capital should own labor', then...all laborers, white or black, are and ought to be slaves.""

Caption 1:  While workers went off to war or stayed behind to support the northern troops, their employers were getting rich. The draft law enabled a man to evade service by getting a substitute or by paying $300. Only the wealthy could afford this and their sons did not have to go off to fight. Many bought a poor man to die for them. Judge Mellon, starter of the Mellon millionaires, told his son that it was ""only greenhorns"" who enlist.  Caption 2:  Based on runaway profiteering, prices charged the people and the government was scandalous. Many modern fortunes had their origin in those days when as one magazine wrote: ""The men button their waistcoats with diamonds...and  women powder their faces with gold and silver dust."" Strikes broke out all over the country as workers needed more money and unions began growing again. Between 1863 and 1864 about 300 new unions were organized.  Caption 3:  Those who opposed the northern cause used labor's grievances to promote riots against the draft. The New York recruiting office was destroyed and for three days a mob rampaged across the city wrecking railroads, street car lines, shipyards, factories and machine shops. Homes and offices of Republican leaders were wrecked. It was estimated that over 400, many Negroes, were killed and wounded and $5 million dollars property destroyed.

Homestead Act.; Land speculation--United States.; Labor unions--United States--History--19th century.","This cartoon depicts the scandals that broke out during the Civil War. It also shows how speculators took advantage of the Homestead Act, which had been adopted to relieve unemployment. Caption 1:  From New York the 1863 draft riots spread upstate, to Pennsylvania, Indiana and Wisconsin. Opponents of the Lincoln government made use of labor's legitimate grievances to promote attacks on army recruiting offices. Workers were told that the freed slaves would take their jobs away. New York unions roused workers to the danger of falling for this propaganda branding the riot leaders as individuals ""who vibrate between the penitentiary and the dark dens of crime.""   Caption 2:  Scandal was heaped on scandal as crooked contractors and manufacturers fleeced the government. Morgan sold the U.S. guns that exploded in the soldiers' hands. Uniforms disintegrated under the rain, sugar supplied the army turned out to be sand, coffee-rye flour and shoes with paper soles were issued to the troops. Fortunes were being made from these deals as well as from high consumer prices. In four years of war the cost of living doubled.  Caption 3:  To help relieve the unemployment during the early part of the civil war, the government passed the Homestead Act giving western lands to those who would work them. Anybody cultivating an acre of land for six months could own it for $1.25 an acre. Speculators moved in, bought land through dummy owners and soon were owners of huge tracts of the best land. Seventy million acres were given to the Union Pacific, Central Pacific and Northern Pacific railroads. Most of this, too, became speculator's property.

Caption 1:  High prices forced northern workers to strike despite their strong sympathies for the Union cause. Out of these strikes came new organization. But labor was still far behind its strength of earlier years. By 1864 there were 200,000 organized -- less than 30 years earlier. But the new unions began coming together in national organizations -- 32 of them by 1865. They began establishing labor newspapers and forming into local trades' assemblies.  Caption 2:  When 7,000 New York members of the Machinists and Blacksmiths struck in 1863, the employers asked the government to extend their contract. A workers' delegation met with President Lincoln who assured them of his personal sympathies and referred them to the Sec'y. of the Navy. They were promised that there'd be no extension for the employers. ""I know,"" Lincoln told the group, ""that in almost every case of strikes, the men have just cause for complaint.""  Caption 3:  In  1864 workingmen's Democratic-Republican Assns. were set up in New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia to back candidates favorable to the north. Association officers met with Lincoln who told them to beware of prejudice. ""The strongest bond of human sympathy,"" the President continued, ""outside of the family relation, should be one uniting all working people of all nations and tongues and kindreds.""

Labor History - 26: Strike Against Machines,Fred Wright,James Lerner,"Strikes, War, Businesses",Strikes and lockouts--United States--History.; Industrial revolution--United States.; Industrialization--United States.; Labor unions--United States--History--19th century.,"This cartoon depicts the high activity of labor during the Civil War, particularly in response to the use of machinery to replace workers. Caption 1:  High prices was one thing bothering Civil War labor. But introduction of machinery which replaced workers was another. Many workers thought they could stop machinery from being used by striking. New York 2,000 grain handlers offered to end their strike in 1862 if the owners stopped using machinery. Blacksmiths and machinists were also out for the same reason. They failed.  Caption 2:  Labor became so active that a Springfield, Mass. paper said in 1863 that ""the workmen of almost every branch of trades have had their strikes within the last few months... . In almost every instance the demands of the employed have been acceded to."" And nearly every strike resulted in the formation of a new union. ""Striking for higher wages"" wrote the San Francisco Bulletin ""is now the rage among the working people.""  Caption 3:  For the first time in U.S. history labor saw vast concentrations of industry and banks facing them. Oil was discovered in Pennsylvania and Ohio; huge iron ore resources were discovered in Michigan. Big packing houses were set up in Chicago and St. Louis. Lawless, ruthless men like N. Jay Gould, E. H. Harriman and James J. Hill battered their way to wealth as they built national railroads.

Caption 1:  As the Civil War came to an end American labor found itself up against employer offensives which included blacklists of those who joined unions; demands that they sign ""yellow-dog"" contracts certifying to having left unions, and newly formed employer associations. ""We are opposed to every combination which has for its objects the regulation of wages,"" one association declared.  Caption 2:  Ohio iron founders and machine builders formed an organization to protect all in the industry ""suffering from the same grievances."" The grievances were the demands of their workers for wage increases to meet the wartime inflation. Strikes were broken by importation of contract labor from overseas. In some instances northern generals used their troops to break strikes and arrest the strikers.  Caption 3:  State governments helped fight unions, too. In New York the owner of an iron foundry which had been organized was permitted to do his work at the Sing Sing foundry paying New York State 40 cents a day for each convict he used instead of the union rate outside jail $3 a day. A Minnesota law (1883) put a six month jail sentence on ""interference"" with scabs. Clearly, national organization was needed.

Labor History - 28: Trade Councils Set Up,Fred Wright,James Lerner,"Union Organization, Scabs",Labor unions--United States--History--19th century.; Strikebreakers--California--San Francisco.,"After attacks on labor during the Civil War, separate unions came together to form trades' assemblies in order to better resist employers and state governments. Caption 1:  Attacks on labor during the Civil War caused the separate unions to come together in trades' assemblies so they could better resist the employers and the state governments which were helping employers keep wages down. By the end of the war there were 30 trades assemblies from New England to California. There were few national unions at that time.  Caption 2:  The handful of national unions that existed were too weak to be of much assistance to their affiliates. When an Employers Assn. brought scabs from the east to break a San Francisco moulders' strike in 1864, representatives of that city's trades' assembly met the scabs at the Isthmus of Panama and persuaded them to refuse to scab. (There was no Panama Canal yet.) Instead, the scabs joined the union.  Caption 3:  Through the new trades' assemblies the workers were able to develop their boycotts of anti-labor companies. Some of them ran libraries, reading rooms and sponsored lectures to help educate the members. Some even opened cooperative stores to help the members meet the high cost of wartime living. At Troy, N.Y. the unionists set up a department store.

At the same time, employers cut wages drastically which prompted the call for a national organization. Caption 1:  The development of city trades' assemblies during the Civil War gave labor the means of developing stronger political action. When the New York state legislature considered a bill to jail strikers for a year (1864), the N. Y. Trades' Assembly held a big street meeting attended by 15,000. Speakers warned the legislators voting for the bill would be ""sent to hell"" in the next election.  Caption 2:  Similar gatherings and expressions in other cities helped defeat the bill just as labor action had licked an anti-strike bill in Massachusetts. But labor was not yet strong enough and employers were slashing wages. Massachusetts nail workers were cut 25%; Troy, N.Y. iron workers suffered a dollar a day wage cut. A national wage cut drive was now forcing a new action on labor.  Caption 3:  There was need for even greater strength and workers began thinking of national organizations. The Louisville, Ky. Trades' Assembly issued a call for a national meeting of similar bodies. ""Are not capitalists and employers of almost every city organizing themselves into unions?"" the call asked. Although only eight central bodies sent delegates, the time was nearing when national organization would be established.

It's main goal was the 8-hour day, which President Andrew Johnson signed into law. Caption 1:  Union soldiers returning from the Civil War found unemployment facing them. There were growing demands for an eight-hour day instead of the 10 being worked. Labor saw the need for national organization. The answer was a national congress which formed the National Labor Union (1866-Baltimore). Of the 60,000 represented, many came from eight-hour day leagues and local unions.  Caption 2:  Organization of the unorganized, independent political action of labor and the eight-hour day were the key resolutions adopted. In the months following there were many successes. ""Seven workingmen or other good citizens,"" wrote an NLU organizer, ""who favor our views...can form a union."" The Ohio chairman wrote of having set up 20 unions. By 1869 membership was set at 600,000 in the NLU.  Caption 3:  The 1866 meeting set up a committee to see President Andrew Johnson on the eight-hour day, on ending convict labor and keeping public lands out of the hands of speculators. Two years later the organization had proven its worth. Congress voted for an eight-hour day for all in government employ.

Caption 1:  The Supreme Court ruled in 1868 that the government did not have to abide by the 8-hour day law passed two years earlier. Taking its fight to the states, labor in California secured 11,000 signatures to a petition for a state 8-hour day law. When this failed, unions announced in the press that as of a certain day their members would work no more than 8-hours daily.  Caption 2:  This tactic worked. The 1868 legislature voted an 8-hour day and labor paraded through the streets on Feb. 22 in a huge torchlight parade. New York passed a similar law as did other states. But most of these were ignored by the employers. So labor took to striking to enforce the law. 25,000, led by the miners, walked out in Pennsylvania.  Caption 3:  A New York parade in 1871, led by the printers' union, had a sign: ""Peaceably if we can, forcibly if we must."" The sign was mounted on a cannon! The next year 100,000 members of 10 unions struck and forced an 8-hour day agreement from the building employers. The victory parade drew from the N.Y. Times the query: ""what proportion of that long column of strikers 'were thoroughly American'?""

Labor History - 32: Women Form Own Unions,Fred Wright,James Lerner,Union Organization,Women labor union members--United States.; Labor unions--United States--History--19th century.,"This cartoon depicts how women formed their own unions after they had entered the workforce during the Civil War. At this time most male unions barred any women from joining. Caption 1:  Women came into industry during the Civil War in great numbers. But many men saw them being used ""at a lower rate than is paid for male labor in the same kind of work."" Instead of blaming the employer, some unions blamed the women and even barred them from membership. In some places women formed their own unions; cigar makers, collar workers, tailors, printers, cap makers among them.  Caption 2:  Some unions helped the women set up their own organizations and helped them run strikes as when Utica, N.Y. employers refused to hire women belonging to the Daughters of St. Crispin, a women's union. There were unions which organized women into their own locals. But it gradually came to be seen that it hurt all labor to have such artificial separation. Among these were the Cigar Makers (1867) and Typographical.  Caption 3:  The women's suffrage movement was appealing to labor to help them get the vote. At the 1868 convention of the National Labor Union, delegates from women's unions were seated despite some opposition. Eighteen delegates threatened to walk out if Elizabeth Cady Stanton, secretary of the Women's Suffrage Assn. were seated. But she was accepted after the meeting voted it didn't mean endorsement of ""her peculiar ideas.""

Caption 1:                                                    Formed in 1868 the National Labor Union, first as a federation of labor, grew rapidly and then fell apart disappearing by 1872. Its leaders had lost faith in union action and had turned to various schemes such as currency reform and cooperatives as labors' best hopes. Meanwhile another labor organization, the Knights of Labor, was coming into being.  Caption 2:  It was a group of Philadelphia garment workers who in 1869 formed the Noble and Holy Order of the Knights of Labor. Grips, passwords, rituals, secret symbols written on sidewalks and fences announcing meeting times and places were part of the Knights. Its leader was Uriah S. Stephens. Unlike most previous unions, he aimed to unite skilled and unskilled regardless of sex, creed, race, color or political affiliation.  Caption 3:  Through secrecy Stephens hoped to instill fraternity and solidarity in labor. The Knights grew to 700,000 members by 1886. In order to impel members to learn to read and write, each one had to sign his name to a card on a triangular table placed outside the meeting room. Many took courses in writing to be able to fulfill this requirement of membership.

Caption 1:  When nine tailors gathered in Philadelphia in December, 1869 to form an organization, they started something which grew to over 700,000 by 1886. The Knights of Labor had such advance demands as ""equal pay for the sexes,"" prohibition of child labor, government ownership of railways and telegraphs, and a graduated income tax.  Caption 2:  The first president, or Grand Master Workman, as he was called, was Uriah S. Stephens, who had been trained for the Baptist ministry but became a tailor. His organizing ideas were vague and surrounded by mystical ideas. Stephens opposed strikes and objected to labor organizing by trades. After a few years he became interested in politics, ran for Congress on the Greenback ticket, lost and dropped away.  Caption 3:  Workers were invited to come to a Knights meeting without being told what it was. If they answered satisfactorily questions put to them on the ""elevation of labor,"" they were held eligible to join. Even the name of the organization was never mentioned in public so that no one would know it existed unless he was a member. When an ""assembly"" grew large, some would be allowed to ""swarm"" to form another group of Knights.

Workers responded by striking. Caption 1:  Growing labor unions after the Civil War helped boost living standards a great deal but suddenly, in 1873, the big banking firm of Jay Cooke and Co. collapsed and with it came down the whole economy. For the next six years the country was soaked in misery. It was estimated that a fifth of the workers were completely jobless in 1877 and only one fifth had regular full time jobs.  Caption 2:  In 1873 there were 30 national unions. Four years later only eight or nine were left. Hours of work were lengthened to 10 where the 8-hour day had been won. In 1874 about 90,000 homeless workers, two-fifths women, lived in New York City's police station houses, for the one or two days lodging permitted them each month. They slept on benches. This assistance to the unemployed the press branded as ""communistic"" as it sapped ""independence of character.""  Caption 3:  Another paper, the New York World, said the answer was ""lower wages"" and the employers agreed. The answer was ""strike."" In 1874 the Fall River, Mass. textile workers struck against a 10 percent wage cut. Employers rejected a proposal for arbitration as UnAmerican. The wage cut was taken back after one month. A few months later it was reintroduced. The militia was called out against them and after several months of strike the workers lost.

Some demonstrations became violent, such as Tomkins Square in New York in 1874. Caption 1:  To meet the financial panic New York unions in December, 1873 called a conference on unemployment. Result was demands for an 8-hour day to provide more jobs and for a $30,000 limit on wealth owned by any individual. Then the unemployed warned the city that they would take proper food and shelter ""and we will send our bills to the City Treasury, to be liquidated, until we shall obtain work and pay for our work.""  Caption 2:  Other cities acted similarly. Everywhere the 8-hour day was the top demand. Twenty thousand marched on Chicago's City Hall demanding that money left over from the Chicago fire aid society be turned over. In an attempt at frightening the demonstrators, they were told that only those who would submit to vaccination would be helped. The rush to the doctors smashed this ruse. The money was paid out.  Caption 3:  But the City Council in Chicago never met the demand of the people for ""bread for the needy, clothing for the naked, and houses for the homeless."" A peaceful demonstration in New York's Tompkins Square on Jan., 1874 was attacked by the police. Many were clubbed and trampled. Hundreds were seriously injured and some arrested--to be sentenced later for attacking the police.

Caption 1:  The 1874 unemployed demonstrations were branded by the press as the doings of foreign radicals. Of the biggest, Tompkins Square, N.Y., the N.Y. Times wrote: ""The persons arrested yesterday seem all to have been foreigners--chiefly Germans or Irishmen. Communism is not a weed of natural growth."" Among those at whom the cops clubs swung at this rally were Samuel Gompers, later first AFL president.  Caption 2:  Strikes against wage cuts broke out everywhere, including the Pennsylvania coal mines. Many miners joined a secret organization, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, to defend themselves. The employers and the press dubbed this organization the Molly Maguires and declared open war on its members. The operators sent in an armed police force which killed miners. Mine bosses and foremen were in turn killed by the aroused workers.  Caption 3:  The anti-union Philadelphia and Reading Railroad hired the Pinkerton agency to send spies into the workers' organization. One of them, James McParland, later testified in court that the Molly Maguires had plotted murder. Miners' witnesses were convicted of perjury, discouraging others from helping them. Ten were hanged, 14 others jailed. Later the operators' paper admitted that the workers' crime had been: ""Whenever prices of labor did not suit them they organized and proclaimed a strike.""

The railroads used spies to try and attack the railroad unions. Caption 1:  A month after the leaders of the Pennsylvania mine workers were executed, the railroad workers launched one of the biggest labor battles this country had seen. A series of wage cuts had reduced their weekly wage to $5 to $10 a week. On top of this they had only part-time work and had to pay the company hotel for room and board while away from home. For many the take-home pay, as a result, was as little as 35 or 40 cents a week.  Caption 2:  Public sympathy tended to be with the workers. For years the railroads had robbed the country. Land grabs, stock manipulation, bribery of public officials had brought the farmers, small businessmen, miners and other sections of the population to hate the railroads. The press called it ""insurrection"" when 40 firemen and brakemen quit their freight train jobs in Baltimore. The police moved to the attack.  Caption 3:  Pinkerton spies who had been used to frame-up the Molly Maguires were now used to attack the railroad unions. Blacklisting of members was common. When on June 1, 1877 the Pennsylvania and other railroads announced another 10 percent wage cut, the explosion took place. Wives and mothers were among the active strike demonstrators. The Baltimore Sun wrote of these women: ""They look famished and wild and declare for starvation rather than have their people work for the reduced wages.""

Many were killed or wounded after militiamen were brought in. Caption 1:  The strike of 40 firemen and brakemen on the Baltimore and Ohio sparked a nationwide rail strike which spread all the way to California. The high spot was Pittsburgh where the Pennsylvania Railroad had cut wages and ordered each crew to take out 36 cars instead of the previous 18. This would have meant the laying off of half the workers. A committee of engineers offered to accept the wage cut if promised that it would be taken back when business got better.  Caption 2:  Secretly, the Trainmen's Union, an industrial organization, was formed taking in engineers, conductors, brakemen and firemen. The workers stopped freight train movements by massing on the tracks. When Sheriff Fife read the riot act they refused to break up the massed strikers. Take back the wage cut and layoff order, the workers demanded. Delegations of businessmen and miners came to declare support.  Caption 3:  The governor brought in the Philadelphia militia which fired into a crowd, killing 20 men, women and children; 29 were wounded. A Grand Jury investigating the assault branded it ""unauthorized, willful and wanton killing--murder."" Thousands of workers from mills, mines, factories marched to the scene and drove the troops to seek shelter in the roundhouse where they spent the night surrounded.

The press labeled the strikers as communists and the strike ended violently with many killed and wounded. Caption 1:  From Pittsburgh the railroad strike spread on the Erie and New York Central railroads through New York, to Erie, Pa. on to Chicago and the west coast. The press was wild. The N.Y. Herald called the strikers ""a wild beast and needs to be shot down."" The N.Y. World said Pittsburgh was ""in the hands of men dominated by the devilish spirit of communism."" When the militia was called out in Buffalo, N.Y. a company of troops joined the strikers.  Caption 2:  By July 24, 1877, Michigan Central strikers in Chicago had been joined by most other workers in that city in what was almost a general strike. ""The City in Possession of Communists,"" the N.Y. Times headlined although all it was a fight against a wage cut. 20,000 strikers marched there with banners: ""We Want Work Not Charity,"" ""Why Does Overproduction Cause Starvation?""  Caption 3:  Two days later the strikers were attacked by cavalrymen waving swords at the Halsey Street viaduct. Twelve were killed and many wounded. Federal troops were brought in from Indian territory. Strike headquarters were smashed; many workers' leaders jailed.

Most of the strikes of 1877 did not attain their ends. Caption 1:  While troops were smashing the Chicago general strike in 1877, railroad workers in St. Louis struck against a wage cut. Other workers came out in support urging the strikers to hold out for an eight-hour day as well. By July 29 every business in St. Louis was shut and a workingmen's  committee was running the city. The mayor rejected company appeals to arrest the strikers.  Caption 2:  But the Governor of Missouri stepped in. The militia and federal troops took charge raiding strike headquarters and arrested the entire strike committee. They were charged with conspiracy. Four of the men received five-year terms and $2,000 fines. The strike was broken by August 2. A novel development in the strike was the march of about 300 Negro levee laborers from factory to force them to close.  Caption 3:  Most of the 1877 strikes did not attain their ends so that by the time that depression was over wages had been cut sharply. By 1883 wages had dropped below 1870 so that the average yearly wage was about $558 and average living costs for a family was at $754. Many unions had disappeared and the eight-hour day was still rare. Bakers put in from 80 to 120 hours a week; textile workers about 60 and transportation--90 to 100 hours.

Caption 1:  With the end of the 1877 depression labor, greatly weakened, saw  the need for national unity. To Peter J. McGuire, a Carpenters Union organizer, fell the job of writing a call to a national congress which was held in Pittsburgh with 107 delegates in attendance. Representing a half-million workers they set up the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions of the United States and Canada.  Caption 2:  Five years later this name was changed to American Federation of Labor. (In 1936, Myrtle McGuire, daughter of Peter, was founding member of UE, at the Camden, N.J. RCA plant.) The new association's program declared: ""A struggle is going on in the nations of the civilized world between the oppressors and the oppressed of all countries, a struggle between capital and labor, which must grow in intensity from year to year...""  Caption 3:  The federation came out for compulsory education, an end to child labor, enforcement of the national eight-hour day law; a national bureau of labor statistics and labor political action. Meanwhile the Knights of Labor had grown to 700,000. But in a few years this national labor group started falling apart.

These immigrants were used as cheap labor and as scabs. Caption 1:  The 1880's saw the tremendous development of machinery in American industry. Skilled handicraftsmen disappeared with the flood of inventions which averaged about 21,000 a year. One manufacturer boasted that he regarded his ""employees as I do a machine, to be used to my advantage, and when they are old and of no further use, I cast them in the streets.""  Caption 2:  To man the rapidly expanding railroads and industry, the employers turned to immigrants. Between 1880-90 over 5.5 million arrived mainly from Russia, Italy, Hungary, Rumania, Germany and the Scandinavian countries. Company agents scoured Europe promising ""streets paved with gold."" Others were picked off the piers in New York and shipped directly to steel mills, mines and textile mills.  Caption 3:  Many were brought in to scab on strikers who had revolted against miserable wages. Unable to speak English, the immigrants did not know to what they had been brought. When they learned the truth many rebelled. So did 500 Jewish immigrants who, brought to scab on N.Y. Central freight handlers, walked off a pier and to the union hall. A day later 250 Italians followed them. UE News, Vol. XXXIII, Issue No. 26",1971-12-27,,Publication plate,Comic strips,ue13.3.1.043,ue13.3.1.043,ue13.3.1,copyrighted,,20080924-fredwright-0043.tif

The press labeled the strikes as the workings of communism. Caption 1:  By 1886 American workers were fighting desperately to win back some organization and some of the wages and conditions they had lost in the depression of the previous years. Major issue of the times was the 8-hour day. The Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions (later AFL) urged a general strike for May 1 to demand the shorter work day. The demand swept the country causing newspapers to complain that ""communism was rampant."" The slogan ""Eight Hours Shall Constitute a Day's Labor"" was denounced  Caption 2:  by employers as leading to ""loafing, gambling, rioting, de-bauchery and drunkenness."" Workers sang: We want to feel the sunshine; we want to smell the flowers; We're sure that God has willed it, and we mean to have eight hours. We're summoning our forces from shipyard, shop and mill; Eight hours for work, eight hours for rest, eight hours for what we will.  Caption 3:  May 1, 1886 found an estimated 350,000 workers in 11,562 places of business on strike for the 8-hour day. Chicago newspapers reported that every railroad was crippled, and most of the industries were paralyzed. The stockyards closed down and the packinghouse workers won the reduced day without a cut in pay as did tens of thousands of others.

Towards the end of a peaceful gathering 180 policemen marched in and ordered the meeting to disperse. Suddenly bomb was thrown killing one policeman and wounding five. The police response was gunfire and clubbing of the crowd.  Several were killed; 200 wounded.    Caption 3:  Chicago became a jungle in which union men were the hunted.

Some of the jurors admitted that they were prejudiced against the workers on trial. The state attorney general gave away the real aim of the trial. ""They are no more guilty than the thousands who follow them ... hang them and you save our institutions.""  Caption 2:  The aim was to break up the fight for the 8-hour day which was branded ""communistic"" and ""anarchistic."" Seven were sentenced to be hanged, one to 15 years in jail. Defendant August Spies warned the court that they would not be able to ""stamp out the labor movement"" with the hangings. Instead the executions would fan the spark of labor organization and flames would blaze up. ""You cannot put it out.""  Caption 3:  Who threw the bomb was never actually discovered. But there has been strong evidence that it was a put-up job. In 1900 a Chicago daily claimed one of the arrested, Rudolph Schaubelt, had actually thrown the bomb but was the only one freed by the police.

Members of the French Chamber of Deputies wired the governor to stop the ""political crime.""  Caption 2:  The employers, especially in Chicago, maintained their pressure for carrying out the sentences against the leaders of the 8-hour day demonstration. Finally, public opinion prevailed on Governor Oglesby to commute to life imprisonment the sentences of Fielden and Schwab. One of the convicted, Louis Lingg, committed suicide and four were hanged on Nov. 11, 1887--Parsons, Engel, Fischer and Spies.

Caption 1:  Although the Knights of Labor had grown to a big national federation of at least 700,000 members by the early 1880's, it had begun to decline when the Haymarket case took place. Its leader, Terence Powderly opposed the 8-hour day strikes and like the present head of the AFL-CIO, George Meany, boasted that he had never participated in a strike. Instead of striking, he advised members to write essays on the 8-hour day.  Caption 2:  The organization's funds were invested in cooperatives which were presented as the way to beat ""the system."" The cooperatives were a failure. Strikes initiated by the members in different parts of the country were not supported by the Knights and most of them were lost. In two years' time the membership dwindled to 200,000. By 1893 it had dropped to 75,000.  Caption 3:  An unsuccessful attempt was made to end rivalry between the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions which had been formed in 1881 and the Knights. When this proved impossible, representatives of 25 labor organizations with a membership of 150,000 met at Columbus, Ohio in Dec., 1886 to form the American Federation of Labor with Samuel Gompers, a cigar maker union official, as president.

Pamphlets were to be printed, meetings held and the whole working people prepared for a general strike on May 1, 1890. Unorganized workers were called to set up Eight-Hour Leagues. A Slogan of the movement was: ""Eight hours for work, eight hours for rest, eight hours for what we will.""  Caption 2:  On Washington's birthday, 1889, 240 mass meetings were held in as many cities which adopted 8-hour day resolutions. On July 4, 311 such meetings took place. On Labor Day the number had grown to 420. The AFL distributed over half a million circulars, 50,000 pamphlets. Pres. Samuel Gompers urged an International socialist meeting in Paris that year to mark May 1 as ""International Labor Day,"" the start of the 8-hour day.  Caption 3:  After further consideration it was decided to forego a general strike but to have the Carpenters start the fight with the backing of the rest of labor. On May 2, 1890 a New York daily headlined: ""Everywhere the Workmen Join in Demands for a Normal Day."" Another headline: ""Parade of Jubilant Workingmen In All the Trade Centers of the Civilized World."" Thirty thousand marched in Chicago; 70 unions were in the N. Y. demonstration.

The workers were locked out of the factory after they rejected company demands, and soon the company was advertising for scabs. Caption 1:  The demand for the 8-hour day in 1890 was so popular among working people that unions experienced very rapid growth. In four months the Carpenters Union added 132 new locals. And it won its demand. As a result of the May 1st strikes that year, hundreds of thousands of workers across the country had their hours reduced. AFL Pres. Gompers wrote that with this movement labor had won new ""courage and hope.""  Caption 2:  Two years later, labor was up against a major attack from some of the biggest employers. Officials of the Carnegie Steel Co. informed employees at the Homestead, Pa., works that at the expiration of the contract with the Amalgamated Assn. of Iron and Steel Workers, the union would no longer be recognized and wages cut by a 22 percent average. The workers rejected the company demands but sought further negotiations.  Caption 3:  Instead, they soon found themselves locked out. Although the union had been limited to the skilled workers, all 3,800, including those who had not been permitted to join, voted to fight the company. The workers put a steam launch onto the river to watch for scabs. The company began advertising for scabs as far away as Boston, St. Louis and Philadelphia. It arranged for 300 Pinkerton guards to run in scabs.

Caption 1:  The 300 Pinkerton guards hired to break the strike of Homestead steelworkers were armed with rifles and put on two barges towed by a steamboat down the Monongahela River, a few miles from the struck mill. The aim was to sneak them in unseen by the strikers. But this maneuver failed when the strikers got wind of it. They broke through the fence surrounding the mill.  Caption 2:  The barges they had come on were set afire. All over the country labor protested this brutal attack and the strike continued with wide support from labor. A few days later, however, Gov. Pattison answered the demand of the Carnegie Steel Co. and ordered out 8,000 National Guardsmen. His reason: ""the actual communism of these people. They believe the works are their's quite as much as Carnegie's.  Caption 3:  The armed strikebreakers started firing into the crowd and were answered in kind. The workers floated burning, oil-soaked boxes on the river. The battle of Homestead had started at 4 a.m. on July 6, 1892. It raged until 5 that afternoon. At least 9 workers were killed and three of the Pinkertons. Surrender terms were finally agreed on-the agents were to march off to a skating rink.

In November, the strike collapsed and strikers went back to work, many of whom were fired. Caption 1:  National Guardsmen started escorting scabs into the Homestead plant and 7 strikers were charged with murdering a Pinkerton dick. But still the Carnegie Steel Co. could not get the mill going. It persuaded a Grand Jury to indict 167 workers on six counts including murder, rioting and conspiracy. The strike leaders were jailed and denied bail. For the rest half a million dollars bail was ordered. It couldn't be raised.  Caption 2:  To these charges was added one of ""treason"" against the strike advisory committee and 34 were held on this. State Supreme Court Judge Paxson told the trial jury that the ""foreigners"" among the laboring population had to be taught a lesson about what liberty means. The jury thought otherwise and all strikers were acquitted. But the expense of the legal defense and the time this took was a heavy burden.  Caption 3:  By November the strike which had begun in July was proving too great a burden to the workers. Strike relief dwindled. The fight had to be called off. When the workers returned to their jobs, company superintendent Charles M. Schwab made them line up for him to choose those he wanted to rehire. The strike broke the union, the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel and Tin workers. Carnegie plants were never organized-until the 1930's.

Labor History - 53: Convict Labor I,Fred Wright,James Lerner,"Strikes, Scabs",Convict labor--Tennessee--Coal Creek.; Strikes and lockouts--Tennessee--Coal Creek.; Labor unions--United States--History--19th century.,"In 1891, miners at Coal Creek, Tennessee fought against the state using convict labor to fill in for the miners on strike. The miners used guns and captured the convicts and the guards, using them as tools for negotiation with the governor. Caption 1:  The Homestead steel strike wasn't the only one to be smashed in the early 1890's by a combination of employer violence-courts and troops. At Coal Creek, Tenn. in 1891 miners fought against the use of convict labor supplied by the state. Prisoners were sent to tear down the strikers' homes and the lumber was used to build a stockade for the strikebreaker-criminals.  Caption 2:  Miners and other citizens, armed with guns, marched on the stockade, seized the convicts and their guards and paraded them to a railroad. The governor sent in the militia. The state labor movement advised him that if any shots were fired, 7,500 men would come to back the miners. Two thousand armed workingmen were outside when a committee went to see the militia commander.  Caption 3:  The commander gave up the thought of seizing the committee, and permitted the miners to march the convicts and his troops to a train. Elsewhere other groups of convicts were shipped away. The governor called a special session of the legislature where he said that giving up convict labor would cost the state $100,000 a year. He got a new law making interference with the convicts a worse crime punishable by 5 years in prison.

Troops were brought in and leaders were convicted, which ended the movement, however convict labor came to an end shortly after. Caption 1:  Repeatedly, contingents of miners returned to areas where convicts were being employed in the Tennessee coal mines. Armed, some with masked faces, the miners would free the convicts and in some cases supply them with civilian clothes. Rewards for arrests of the union leaders went untaken as there was wide support for the workers.  Caption 2:  In August, 1892, 3,000 Tennessee and Kentucky miners assaulted a convict stockade at Oliver Springs, Tenn. They disarmed the militia and burned the stockade. Railroad workers refused to move a regiment of militia to the scene from  Chattanooga. Finally, troops armed with artillery came to attack the workers and drove them from the hills opposite Fort Anderson.  Caption 3:  Arrests, convictions of leaders to jail terms and use of troops finally broke the fight against convict mine labor. But such tremendous support had been gained by the United Mine Workers that when the state's contract to supply convicts to the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railway Co. ran out in 1896, it was not renewed. It had taken 25 years to end the use of convict labor in Tennessee.

Caption 1:  While the miners were fighting convict labor in Tennessee others in that industry were also organizing against slave conditions. Replying to such organization, mine owners in Couer d'Alene, Idaho formed a Mine Owners' Protective Assn. in 1892. They closed the mines and announced a 25 percent wage cut accompanied by a declaration that they'd no longer employ anybody belonging to a union.  Caption 2:  Scabs were brought from Minnesota; armed guards toured Idaho to recruit farmers as scabs or deputized U.S. marshals. Many of the scabs were persuaded by the locked-out miners to go home. At one mine which was working, the miners loaded a railroad car with explosives and sent it on its way. The mine was destroyed and the scabs surrendered. In the fight that followed three miners were killed.  Caption 3:  Their lock-out being defeated, the mine operators had the governor declare a ""state of insurrection."" About 1,500 federal troops and militia came, threw 600 workers into ""bull pens,"" arrested the strike leaders and supporters of the union. Of over 500 indicted only nine were convicted of contempt of injunction. The lockout was beaten, the wage cut taken back and the basis laid for the Western Federation of Miners.

Caption 1:  One of the major depressions which have hit the country periodically struck in 1893. Out of five million workers at least three million lost their jobs. Sixteen thousand companies including 642 banks went broke. The AFL urged labor to hold demonstrations to demand relief. In many cities the unemployed were attacked by the police but many cities were forced to set up soup kitchens and provide work in parks.  Caption 2:  Wages for such work was about 10 cents an hour for family men-feed and lodging for others. At its 1893 convention the AFL declared that the ""right to work is the right to life,"" and called for federal action. The following spring a rich Ohio manufacturer, Jacob Coxey, called for public works to provide jobs. He called for a march on Washington and the response came from all over the U. S. Ten thousand arrived there on May 1, 1894.  Caption 3:  The marchers sold a song about their cause for which the price was ""One loaf of bread to feed Coxey's army."" AFL central bodies had endorsed the march. The marchers defied the authorities' ban on parading or carrying banners through the Capitol grounds. Coxey was arrested and sentenced to 20 days for ""walking on the grass."" It wasn't until August 15 that the army had to disband.

Caption 1:  Coxey's army of the unemployed dramatized labor's plight but Congress did nothing. Meanwhile, the employers set out to use the 1893 depression to smash unions. Many unions went broke defending their members. AFL Pres. Gompers wrote that there weren't ""more than two National Unions"" which hadn't been crippled by the attacks. Despite this new groups of workers had to take up organization.  Caption 2:  Outstanding development was the formation of the American Railway Union. Five railroad brotherhoods had been operating independently-and ineffectively. Only one-tenth were organized and annual wages were $957 for engineers, $575 for conductors, $212 for brakemen, $264 for switchmen. Eugene Victor Debs, editor of the Locomotive Firemen's Magazine, called for one single union of all railroad workers. Early attempts to federate failed because some leaders objected.  Caption 3:  When Buffalo, N. Y. switchmen struck for a 10-hour day, they were attacked by the state militia. Their appeal for help from the railroad brotherhoods was turned down so the strike had to be called off. There was new demand for one rail union and Debs pushed ahead. A conference in Chicago formed the ARU to be open to all ""white employees"" of railroads except superintendents and other company officials. Dues were set at $1 a year.

Caption 1:The American Railway Union, sparked by Eugene Victor Debs, drew thousands of members from the various craft unions and from the unorganized. For the first time, when a rail strike was called as one at the Great Northern, all the workers came out. The 9,000 strikers won a tremendous victory and within a year the ARU had grown to 150,000 from 50 members. It had become the biggest union in the country.   Caption 2:  This could not be tolerated by the companies. At Pullman, Ill. employees of the Pullman Co. had their wages cut as much as 50 percent. In the spring of 1894 4,000 Pullman workers joined Debs' union. When their grievance committee was fired, they struck without even getting authorization from the parent union. When Debs proposed arbitration, the company said: ""We have nothing to arbitrate.""  Caption 3:  Scabs were brought in from all over the U.S. and Canada. An employer association said it would blacklist forever any rail worker who refused to scab. The strike spread until 150,000 were out across the country-as far as California. Old-line rail union leaders said they'd provide scabs if called on by the companies. The U.S. Attorney General applied for an injunction against Debs, his associates and the strikers.

Caption 1:  A strike-strangling injunction was issued by a federal judge against the Pullman strikers. The company threatened not to rehire thousands of strikers. Railroad attorney Edwin Walker, appointed special government  attorney, wired Washington that the workers' defiance of the injunction established a need for troops. On July 3, 1894 President Cleveland complied.  Caption 2:  Defying Illinois Gov. Altgeld who said: ""It is not the business of the soldiers to act as custodians or guards of private property,"" the President directed the forces stationed at Fort Sheridan to go to Chicago. The governor wired Cleveland his protest and said that there was no need for troops and that the newspapers had manufactured anti-labor hysteria.  Caption 3:  Newspapers called the strike ""A Revolution."" They lied that hundreds of freight cars had been burned by the strikers. A typical headline was: ""Anarchists and Socialists Said to Be Planning the Destruction and Looting of the Treasury."" The troops killed 25 workers, injured 60.

Caption 1:  While the troops shot at the Pullman rail strikers, the courts were indicting them by the hundreds for ignoring the federal injunction. Eugene V. Debs and the other union heads were among those arrested. Chicago union headquarters were raided and wrecked by deputy marshals. The big strike was left leaderless with no one to advise the workers in different parts of the country. An attempt to organize a general strike failed.  Caption 2:  The strike was broken amid charges that AFL Pres. Samuel Gompers had betrayed it by ""refusing to rally labor support for the rail workers. In his biography the AFL head later wrote that one of the things he had in his mind was weakening the American Railway Union on behalf of the old line craft rail unions. To this day the railway workers are divided into many separate craft groups-something which Debs had tried to end.    Caption 3:  Debs was sent to jail for six months and the other union leaders for lesser terms. His lawyer was the then unknown Clarence Darrow. By 1897 practically nothing was left of the American Railway Union. To Debs the use of the federal government to smash the Pullman strike was evidence that workers needed a political party to fight capitalism.

Caption 1:  Repeated depressions, smashing of strikes by government injunction and troops, the force being used to break up demonstrations of hungry working people, and the squeeze on the farmers inspired new attempts at independent political action in the 1890's. Foremost was the People's Party which grew up among the midwest farmers. Among the demands of the party were an 8-hour day and outlawing of the Pinkerton detective agency strikebreakers.  Caption 2:  Many unions joined the Populists (People's Party). In its first presidential election, the party polled over a million votes receiving 22 electoral college votes. Ten Representatives and five Senators were elected by the party. In several states their candidates for governor won. When Cripple Creek, Col. miners struck for an 8-hour day in 1894, Populist Gov. Waite called out the troops to protect them. In Kansas, Populist Gov. Lewelling demanded that the railroads remove strikebreakers.  Caption 3:  But the leaders of the AFL, led by Gompers, were determined that labor steer clear of politics. This greatly weakened the third party. The party was also torn between those who favored a fight against monopolies and others who would use it to promote free coinage of silver. By 1896 the People's Party was washed up.

Caption 1:  The loss of the Homestead steel and Pullman strikes encouraged those in the AFL who wanted to restrict the organization to craft unionism. Generally these were the same who were against admitting the unskilled Negroes and millions of immigrants arriving in the country at the end of the 19th century. The AFL leaders demanded that immigration be stopped. They said Italians, Poles, Russians, Rumanians, Slovaks could never be organized.  Caption 2:  These immigrants were denounced as being criminal types, willing to work for low wages, or as radical trouble-makers. One union which tried to unite instead of divide was the United Mine Workers, organized in 1890. Two years later, 150,000 miners answered a strike call in the eastern Pennsylvania anthracite mines. With a 10-hour day, frequent layoffs, their yearly earnings averaged $300. Fatal accidents were frequent, 441 being killed in 1901 alone.  Caption 3:  The united operators hired 3,000 ""coal and iron"" police and 1,000 special deputies to herd scabs. George F. Baer, the owners' spokesman, declared that ""God in His infinite wisdom has given the control of the property interests"" to the mine owners and refused to deal with the union.

The National Assn. of Manufacturers, set up in 1895, the National Civic Federation and employer industry associations were on the rampage. U.S. Steel said it would not deal with any union. The packinghouse companies smashed strikes where union recognition was sought.  Caption 2:  For 14 years union and company fought through the courts. In 1916 the union finally was directed to pay $252,000. The bank accounts of the union members were attached and their homes subjected to attempts at  foreclosure. The entire labor movement rallied to the workers' defense and raised the money for the fines.  Caption 3:  The NAM convention in 1903 heard its president warn against ""an attitude of conciliation . . . the greatest danger lies in the recognition of the union."" A major struggle of the period was that of the Danbury, Conn. hatworkers in 1902 who sought union recognition.

Sherman Act.; Strikebreaking--United States.; Trusts, Industrial--United States.; Labor unions--United States--History--20th century.","This cartoon depicts big business control over government and misuse of legislation, like the Anti-Trust Act, to stamp down union rebellion. Caption 1:  The turning of the Sherman anti-trust act into a weapon to break strikes; the use of court injunctions for the same end aroused the labor movement to a new danger. Then, AFL Pres. Samuel Gompers was sentenced to a year in jail for advising workers to boycott products of a struck stove company. The AFL leader was shocked that even though he was trying to promote friendship for employers, and oppose independent political action, he was given treatment usually reserved for labor radicals.  Caption 2:  The Supreme Court overthrew the Gompers conviction but the AFL convention in 1906 appealed to Congress for exemption from the Sherman Act and relief from court injunctions. Ignored, Gompers asked the Democratic and Republican conventions two years later for support. It opposed Republican Presidential nominee, William Howard Taft because he was an injunction judge. It supported the Democrats although Gompers had always insisted labor should not take political sides.  Caption 3:  The assaults on labor, supported by government led to a drop in AFL members so that by 1910 there were fewer belonging than in 1904. Labor was facing a new situation-giant industrial trusts like U.S. Steel, International Harvester, General Electric. These were the creations of the bankers headed by J. P. Morgan. A handful of men were manipulating the country. With their huge wealth they became tough customers for labor.

(Eugene Victor), 1855-1926.; Haywood, William D.; Labor unions--United States--History--20th century.","This cartoon illustrates how unions like the Industrial Workers of the World were started to protect unskilled workers who were still denied membership to the AFL, and the general socialist sentiments of many of these groups. Caption 1:  Despite the growth of the big industrial trusts which employed large numbers of semi-skilled and unskilled workers, the AFL persisted in its philosophy of organizing only skilled crafts. These corporations were smashing strike after strike, in many cases with government support. Demands grew among workers for industrial organization based on militant defense of labor's rights.  Caption 2:  With the independent Western Federation of Miners as a cornerstone, the Industrial Workers of the World came into being in 1905. Metal miners, lumberjacks, migratory harvest workers, textile workers were among those who joined the IWW. Tough, uncompromising and overriding the prejudices which had limited the AFL's organizing activities, the IWW stirred the whole country. Socialist Eugene Debs, William D. Haywood of the Western Federation of Miners were among its founders. Haywood denounced the AFL as being the ""American Separation of Labor.""  Caption 3:  He and others who led the IWW believed that labor must take over the means of production, the machinery, the factories. They called for a ""workers' government"" to replace capitalism. Many songs, still sung by labor everywhere, grew out of the IWW battles which expressed their militancy. Typical was: 0! I like my boss He's a good friend of mine, And that's why I'm starving Out on the picket line.

Caption 1:  Although the Lawrence, Mass. textile strikers in 1912 were accused in the press of planting dynamite it was soon proved that agents of the American Woolen Co. had done the planting in order to discredit the strikers. The company president was arrested. When troops (martial law had been declared) killed a woman picket, strike leaders Ettor and Giovannitti were arrested as ""accessories to murder.""  Caption 2:  IWW leader Bill Haywood took over leadership of the strike. To lessen the burden of starvation facing the strikers, it was decided to send several hundred children to other communities to be taken care of in the homes of sympathizers. One group left and then as a second  trainload was about to go, the police attacked the line of mothers and children, clubbed them, and dragged them to a military truck.  Caption 3:  The few union members in the mills belonged to the AFL Textile Workers and about 1,000 to the IWW. A spontaneous walkout against the wage cut flared up. And the IWW undertook to turn this into a disciplined strike against the wage cut. Two of its leaders, Joseph E. Ettor and Arturo Giovannitti, came to help. The press accused the strikers of being dynamiters. Police fired on the pickets and killed a woman.

Caption 1:  While the IWW, formed in 1905, never became the dominant labor organization in numbers, its free speech fights, its attempts to organize industrial unions won them the bitter hatred of employers and instilled new spirit among working people. When local authorities in a western town like Walla Walla, Wash. tried to suppress  organization among lumberjacks, the ""Wobblies"" poured in from everywhere to defend ""free speech.""  Caption 2:  Jails were filled to overflowing until the authorities had to give up and free the prisoners. One of the most famous of the IWW organizing efforts was of the textile workers in Lawrence, Mass. in 1912. Thirty thousand workers had their wages cut by the American Woolen Co. These Italian, Polish, Lithuanian and Russian mill workers would earn less than $9 a week-if on a full week.  Caption 3:  Protests against this brutality swept the area and the country. Although 296 were arrested in the two months of the strike, the American Woolen Co. finally had to confess defeat. Wages were raised 5 to 25 percent, time and a quarter for overtime and other gains made. The strikers warned that unless Ettor and Giovannitti were freed they'd strike again; 15,000 struck for 24 hours in protest. The two were found innocent.

People were voting to make changes for working class people. Caption 1:  Victorious in the Lawrence, Mass. strike, the IWW gained prestige across the country. At the same time, working people and other sections of the population were shocked by the corruption in politics, the big business control of city, state and federal governments. This was ""The Progressive Era"" when Woodrow Wilson was elected on a ""New Freedom"" platform and Socialist Eugene V. Debs received over 800,000 votes in 1912.  Caption 2:  Anti-monopoly candidates like Tom Johnson and Sam ""Golden Rule"" Jones were elected mayors of Cleveland and Toledo. Jones took the clubs away from the police so they couldn't beat strikers; cut the tax rate of the poor. Johnson set up a city-owned three cent fare trolley line to compete with the privately-owned five cent line. It was the muckraking period when authors like Upton Sinclair exposed the meat trust, Lincoln Steffens the political corruption.  Caption 3:  Labor forced the passage of the Clayton Act which limited use of injunctions, made picketing lawful. The Supreme Court soon emasculated this law. The Labor Department was established (1913). From 25 states labor wrung laws limiting the length of the working day and for the first time in history child labor laws, sought for a century, were passed by states. By 1915 labor had won workmen's compensation laws in 35 states and the railroad workers got their first 8-hour day.

Caption 1:  With unions gaining an important foothold in industry, the expanding trusts hit on the idea of company unions. A pioneer in this movement was the John D. Rockefeller family, owners of Standard Oil and numerous other corporations. When members of the United Mine Workers at the Rockefeller Colorado Fuel & Iron Co. in Ludlow, Col. struck against starvation and the company union scheme in 1914, there began one of the most horrible chapters in American history.  Caption 2:  Thrown out of the company-owned houses, the miners set up a tent colony. Rockefeller hired the Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency who brought in between 1,000 and 2,000 plug uglies to break the strike. These were inducted into the State Militia. They poured oil on the tents, set them afire and turned machine guns on the fleeing miners, wives and children. Eleven children and two women were found burned to death.  Caption 3:  The country was shocked. There were picket lines at the Rockefeller offices in the Wall Street area. A Congressional committee heard John D. Rockefeller, Jr. (father of today's New York governor) say in answer to a question as to whether killing people was going too far in fighting unions, that his company would do anything rather than give in to the miners. Of the murderers he said: ""We expect to stand by the officers at any cost.""

Caption 1:  The Easter massacre of the miners at Ludlow, Colo. shocked the whole country and made the name of Rockefeller one of the foulest in the land. The striking miners turned their fury on the imported armies of thugs, now organized as a ""militia."" Finally federal troops were called in by the Governor. Rockefeller turned down all peace proposals including those made by President Wilson. By December, 1914 the strike was crushed.  Caption 2:  The millionaire had made not belonging to the union a condition of employment. But what he and others did to maintain their rule, resulted in a huge growth of the Mine Workers who added 150,000 to their rolls in a short time. The UMW's militancy was in sharp contrast to the rest of the AFL's docility. In the men's clothing industry the AFL United Garment Workers' sellout deals with employers (1911-1913) led to a rank and file rebellion.  Caption 3:  At the UGW's 1913 convention, the national officers moved to squelch the rebellion by barring the rank and file delegates as ineligible. The ousted delegates left and formed their own organization headed by Sidney Hillman. These rank and filers had already organized the industry's largest company, Chicago's Hart, Schaffner & Marx. By 1915 the new Amalgamated was the major union in men's clothing. The AFL union had lost 50,000 members.

It also shows the inhumane conditions the ""needle trade"" unions fought against and new safety legislation for factory workers. Caption 1:  Like the mine workers, the newly-formed Amalgamated Clothing Workers (1913) overrode AFL craft-union prejudices and admitted to membership  everyone in the industry. A third union organizing at the time, the Ladies Garment Workers, did the same. These ""needle trades"" unions were made up largely of Jewish immigrant workers most of whom believed that all industry would eventually have to be owned by the people through the government.  Caption 2:  These workers were impelled to organization by some of the worst conditions any people have had to endure. Men, but mainly women and young girls--13-14 years old, had to put in up to 14 hours a day in dirty slum-holes. In 1910, 20,000 of these struck against sweatshop conditions in the New York shirtwaist industry. They won a 6-day, 54-hour week, abolition of homework which had led to whole families working day and night; abolished company charges for use of electricity and materials.  Caption 3:  But as important as these were the battles for safe, sanitary working conditions. This was dramatized by the terrible Triangle Shirt Waist factory fire in 1911. When the fire broke out the workers rushed to the exits and found them jammed. When the blaze was put out, there were 146 women burned to death. A horrified public demanded and won some new laws on factory safety and inspection in many states.

Caption 1:  While the miners and the needle trade workers were achieving many organizing successes through industrial unions, the AFL stuck to its craft set-up and continued to ignore the developing steel, automobile, electrical, meat packing and other mass production industries. Ninety percent of the workers remained unorganized before the first World War and nothing was being done about it by the AFL.  Caption 2:  The old-line leaders ridiculed the efforts of the IWW and anyone else who urged industrial organization. Efforts to keep workers from striking during World War I failed as profiteers ran away with prices. In addition, such noted labor leaders as Eugene Debs branded the war as one for profits. By the end of 1917, over a million workers had struck, more than at any time before the war.  Caption 3:  The amount of profiteering in the war years was emphasized by the making of 20,000 new millionaires in the United States. After the war President Wilson told a public meeting that ""this was commercial and industrial war."" (Sept. 5, 1919.) With labor in ferment, it was natural that employers would seek to repress them and wherever possible get subservient politicians to help them. The Tom Mooney-Warren Billings case was oneof the results.

Caption 1:  As a preparedness day parade wound through San Francisco on July 11, 1916 someone threw a bomb at the marchers. Nine were killed, 40 wounded. The authorities arrested two young labor leaders. Tom Mooney and Warren K. Billings. The former, an AFL moulder had recently led a street car workers' strike. Witnesses were to testify that the two had been seen throwing the bomb. They were found guilty and sentenced to die.  Caption 2:  All over the country workers demonstrated their protests as did others in Europe. Labor defense committees sprang up. A presidential commission headed by Felix Frankfurter, later a Supreme Court Justice, declared that the utilities had been out to ""get"" Mooney. An official report to the Secretary of Labor declared that the aim of the prosecution had been to help employers conduct ""their various business enterprises upon the principle of the open shop.""  Caption 3:  Star prosecution witness Oxnam was proven a perjurer. Years later another star witness confessed  perjury. And it was proven that the jury foreman had worked with the prosecution.

(Eugene Victor), 1855-1926.; Labor unions--United States--History--20th century.","This cartoon illustrates the escalating tensions between laborers and the businesses that were willing to bend the law to their will. Over 4,400 strikes broke out in the first year of U.S. involvement in the war. Caption 1:  The convictions of California labor leaders Mooney and Billings on a fake dynamiting charge was only one incident of many yet to come in which employers and subservient government agencies attacked working people during the first World War. While the AFL leaders in the main supported our participation in the war other unionists said we should stay clear of it.  Caption 2:  Longtime rail union leader and Socialist, Eugene V. Debs was one of those who called it a war for profiteering. Making this charge in a public speech at Canton, Ohio in 1918, Debs, then 63 years old, was arrested and sentenced to 10 years in federal prison. Elsewhere many hundreds of working people met the same fate-all charged with sedition and violation of the Espionage Act. The Supreme Court rejected appeals based on the first amendment, on free speech.  Caption 3:  Although the AFL had pledged full cooperation in the war, the union members found the runaway prices accompanied by runaway profiteering too heavy a burden. Over 4,400 strikes involving over 2 million broke out in 1917, the first year of U.S. participation in the war. These strikes became so widespread that the government decided to set up a War Labor Board to settle all disputes. While strikes subsided, the basis was laid for the huge postwar labor battles.

Caption 1:  While the World War I strike wave subsided for a while it swelled to tremendous proportions as soon as the war ended. The cost of living had doubled in five years, real wages had gone up only 14 percent. In 1919 about 4 million workers struck to try to recover some of the lost ground. Groups which had never had strikes came out.  Caption 2:  Recognition of unions as bargaining representatives was also a major issue. The companies started to take back concessions on this granted under wartime pressure. A National Industrial Conference called by Pres. Wilson on this issue in 1919 collapsed when corporation chiefs including John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and Albert H. Gary, head of U.S. Steel, rejected all recognition of national unionism.  Caption 3:  Instead of granting unions the right to exist, the corporations inspired a nationwide ""red scare"" branding strikes as Moscow-inspired. The Bolshevik revolution had occurred in late 1917 and from then on American employers and their political aides were quick to blame the Russians for U.S. strikes. The biggest strike found 365,000 steel workers out in September, 1919.

Caption 1:  The violence and propaganda turned loose against the 1919 steel strikers had its effect in that a number of the craft unions backed out of their previous support. Cold and hunger did the rest. Banker J. P. Morgan gave the industry his full support in their refusal to negotiate. All industry backed the steel industry fearing that a defeat here would mean organization in other mass production industries.  Caption 2:  The defeated steel workers crawled back to the 12-hour day, the seven day week, with no union. It was not until 16 years later that another serious attempt would be made to organize steel. A report of the Inter-church Commission blamed government officers, the press, the clergy, the large cash surplus held by U.S. Steel and the craft-divided workers for the defeat.  Caption 3:  Hardly were the steel workers defeated but the soft coal miners were thrown into battle in 1919. Having fallen far behind war profit-inflated prices, the mine workers asked for a 60 percent raise, the 30-hour week. The UMW got the usual answer-nothing at all; the war emergency is still on, be patriotic. A strike of 425,000miners was set for Nov. 1. But it never took place.

The Philadelphia Public Ledger saw national strikes as being ""an unlawful conspiracy."" Sen. Poindexter blamed the strikes on ""anarchists and murderous communists."" The AFL, whose affiliates had organized the strikes, was on a spot.  It had promoted ""business unionism"" and been kicked in the face.  Caption 2:  Pushed by its members to resist the monopoly attacks, the AFL held a conference in Dec. 1919 at which it called for a ""Labor's Bill of Rights."" This included ""a living wage,"" union recognition and restrictions on the use of injunctions.  Appeals that it go into political action and set up a labor party were thrown aside.  On the heels of the war inflation and the postwar attacks on unions, the 1921 depression exploded.  Unemployment, wage cuts, bankruptcies- 5 million out of work- hit the country.  Caption 3:  Resisting workers continued their strikes. Seamen had their strike broken by arrests. Their union was slashed to a fifth of its previous size by the blacklisting of thousands of its members. Then the packinghouse workers were forced to go out to protect their wages.

In 1920 this board cancelled all contracts, did away with overtime pay and announced a $60 million wage cut for the railway shopmen.  Caption 2:  The members of six of the railway crafts voted to strike on July 1, 1922. Another union went for arbitration while the Brotherhoods which were spared the wage cut, in a typical divide and conquer scheme, declared themselves above the battle. The 400,000 strikers were declared ""outlaws"" by the Board. The non-striking unions joined the employer drive to keep the trains running and break the strike. Strikebreakers were hired from among college students and others.  Caption 3:  Militia, deputized gunmen went to work on pickets and the federal government mobilized its legal powers to smash the strike. President Harding's attorney general applied for a federal injunction. This was granted and the strikers were barred from holding any meetings, issuing statements, spending the union's fund for the strike and the leaders even denied the right to communicate with each other.

Their defeat hurt  the entire labor movement and people were disillusioned: Union membership dropped from 5 million to 3.5 million. Caption 1:  The most sweeping injunction in American labor history, issued against the railway shop craft strikers in 1922, said that no one could aid the strikers ""by letters, telegrams, telephones, word of mouth."" Attorney General Daugherty announced that the government would be used to ""prevent the labor unions of the country from destroying the open shop."" This denial of free speech even shocked many opponents of the strike.  Caption 2:  Their strike was up against insuperable odds of fellow unionists, employers, press and government. The 400,000 strikers had to agree to separate settlements with individual roads on as best terms as they could get. What had been done to them could be seen from the fact that 175,000 strikers were forced out of their unions and into company unions. The divided railway workers were hit so hard that the entire labor movement was hurt.  Caption 3:  During the first World War the leaders of the AFL unions had seen themselves as having gained a ""partnership"" with the employers and a liberal president, Woodrow Wilson. But by 1923 all these illusions had been wiped out in some of the worst battles ever forced on labor in the U.S. Total union membership dropped from 5 million to 3% million. Wages were slashed, introduction of new machinery saw over a million permanently thrown out of industrial jobs.

They were starved and beaten until they were eventually released since no crimes could be proven. Caption 1:  Attacking unions because they wanted a shorter work week or recognition and higher wages was easier after the first World War if they could be accused of being foreign-influenced and ""red"" at that. On the night of Jan. 2, 1920, Justice Dept. agents conducted a nationwide raid under orders of Atty. Gen. Palmer and a young assistant, J. Edgar Hoover. Ten thousand workers were seized in their homes, meeting halls, on the streets.  Caption 2:  Bostonians saw 400 handcuffed, chained workers marched through the streets. Detroit's federal building had 800 packed into a narrow corridor, without food, for six days. Other forms of torture were the lot of prisoners in Hartford, Philadelphia, other cities. Many were turned over to imprisoned criminals to be beaten. At a Fort Wayne army encampment prisoners brought from Detroit saw their wives and children beaten by federal guards.  Caption 3:  There had never been anything like this in U.S. history. The Justice Dept. said the aim was to destroy the ""radical"" movement. Of those arrested, 6,500 were finally released without charges. They had been ""mistakenly"" arrested. About 3,500 were held for deportation but since no crimes could be proven almost all were eventually released. The Palmer raids were denounced by labor, high officials, Congressmen.

Caption 1:  Twelve of the country's top legal experts including Felix Frankfurter, present Supreme Court justice, called the Atty. Gen. Palmer-J. Edgar Hoover arrests of 10,000 foreign born, a violation of almost every provision of the Bill of Rights. The raids were part of the assault against labor. So was the arrest of Nicolo Sacco, a shoemaker, and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, a fish peddler, Boston residents.  Caption 2:  Arrested in 1920, presumably for having participated in a hold-up at South Braintree, Mass. the Sacco-Vanzetti case was to shake the United States and stir almost the entire world before they were finally executed on August 22, 1927. The two    Italian-born men were anarchists, had opposed U.S. participation in World War I and participated in union activities, raising strike funds for textile workers, held street meetings for Palmer raid victims.  Caption 3:  Although the charge was robbery and murder, the district attorney, and Judge Webster Thayer persuaded the jury that America had to be saved from foreigners with their ""red"" activities.

It ran Sen. Robert M. LaFollette for president and Sen. Burton K. Wheeler for vice. Caption 1:  The 1920's were marked by widespread attacks on unions, on foreign born and on radicals. The employers used their papers and the government agencies to label all one and the same. Behind these assaults on liberty there was proceeding the wildest orgy of speculation and corruption the country had ever seen. It reached into the White House itself where President Harding was surrounded by a gang, including cabinet members, who stole the United States blind.  Caption 2:  The president died in 1923 under what has always been regarded as suspicious circumstances. Some of his cronies including Secy. of Interior Fall went to jail for conniving with the oil companies to give them government-owned oil lands. The whole country was aware of the ""Ohio Gang's"" thievery. Labor and the country were taking such a beating that independent political action was widely recognized as the need of the day. Vice Pres. Coolidge succeeded Harding.  Caption 3:  When the democrats in 1924 nominated Wall Street lawyer John W. Davis and the Republicans the inept Calvin Coolidge, whose claim to fame was that he had broken the Boston policemen's strike, a Progressive Party was formed. It ran Wisconsin Sen. Robert M.

When both old parties refused to recognize labor's demands, the AF L reluctantly agreed to support the third party. The AFL had always, up until then, supported the two major parties.  Caption 2:  This time the executive council found that the two old parties had ""flouted the desires of labor"" are ""in a condition of moral bankruptcy which constitutes a menace and a peril to our country and its institutions."" Many AFL leaders, however, supported the Republicans and backed the Republican Coolidge. Others backed the Wall Street lawyer John W. Davis.

Wall Street boomed from illegitimate business practices, setting the country up for disaster Caption 1:  Republican Coolidge was returned to the White House in 1924. Big business was guaranteed full control of the government and what happened in the next five years set the stage for the worst economic catastrophe this country had ever seen. Labor unions were sold the idea that cooperation with the employers was the only way to permanent prosperity for all. AFL unions ignored the millions of unorganized in mass production industries.  Caption 2:  From 1919 to 1927 productivity of the American worker rose by 53.5 percent. The hours in a week for most ranged from 48 to 54 (in steel) and 60 in street laboring. Speedup was so prevalent that about 25,000 workers were killed annually in industry. Earnings were so low that 60 percent of the families didn't earn the $2,000 a year regarded as the basic minimum needed.  Caption 3:  But Wall Street boomed. Get-rich-quick schemes involved some of the richest men. Insull of Illinois, Richard Whitney, head of the N.Y. Stock Exchange, were notable examples. Millions were sold worthless stock or stock soon to become worthless. Whitney went to jail for his finagling. Insull fled the country when his utility empire collapsed.

Caption 1:  Unlimited speculation and profiteering, rapid expansion of industrial capacity featured the years 1920-1929. While skilled workers made some wage gains, most of labor organized and unorganized fell behind. Millions of families came into 1929 earning below $1,000 a year. The 8-hour day had been gaining ground but the six-day week was still prevalent. Steelworkers, for example, were on a 60-hour week.  Caption 2:  The leaders of the AFL and the big Railroad Brotherhoods saw only unlimited prosperity ahead and felt that labor-management cooperation had to be substituted for aggressive defense of the members' interests. Many unions went into business, opening banks, investing in stocks. Huge mass production industries had grown up but the unions refused to organize them looking on the workers as ignorant and unorganizable.  Caption 3:  In the fall of 1929 the greatest economic disaster ever to hit this country exploded. The stock market collapsed bankrupting hundreds of thousands who had sought to make a quick buck in speculation. Banks from one end of the country to the other folded leaving depositors penniless.

Caption 1:  The economic crash in late 1929 was met by the Republican Administration headed by Pres. Herbert Hoover with a barrage of confidence speeches. Hoover assured the country that all would be well within 60 days. His assurance inspired a wave of ""supply jobs for 60 days"" movements. Millions of workers appeared on the nation's streets to sell surplus apples ""for 60 days.""  Caption 2:  But the 60 days were extended to six months and more factories closed. Millions began losing their homes as mortgage holders foreclosed. Huge stocks of food were burnt and sunk in the ocean because people couldn't buy. Demands by the unemployed that the government provide assistance were met with the objections from the government who said this would be socialism. There was no unemployment insurance then.  Caption 3:  The officials of the labor movement denounced those who demanded federal assistance. This was branded as ""communism,"" as a ""dole"" which would undermine the people's self-respect. Instead, conferences of employers were assembled by the government in Washington. Pledges were made to labor that wages would not be cut and employment maintained. But there were no unions to enforce any pledges. They were worthless.

Caption 1:  For a dozen years unions had been helping employers promote profit-sharing and employee stock ownership schemes as substitutes for wage increases. These were wiped out by the crash. Company pension plans disappeared. The already weak union movement was crumbling. By 1933 there were fewer than 3 million organized, no more than in 1917. The AFL unions made no effort to fight unemployment.  Caption 2:  There were no accurate statistics on the number without jobs. Some said the figure was up to 14 million. The employer-dominated press wrote gleefully: ""Never has there been a period of depression so free from labor strife . . labor has shown its good citizenship . . . Labor deserves a salute."" Willingness to starve seemed to be the main characteristic of the American worker.  Caption 3:  But when AFL Pres. William Green repeated his opposition to unemployment insurance, the Philadelphia Record wrote: ""Liberty to starve? Is that what Mr. Green asks for?"" The rank and file, however, was rejecting that advice. Hunger marches, unemployed demonstrations, refusal to permit evictions from homes, farmers' refusal to allow bankers to oust them from their farms-a political storm was building up between 1929-1932.

Caption 1:  As the depression worsened following the fall of 1929, the Republican Party held firm to the position that everything would turn out all right if the employers were left to themselves. The country was swept by hunger marches and demonstrations of the unemployed. One of the most dramatic was the Bonus March. In 1923 Congress had voted a bonus of $50 or $100 to be paid veterans in 1945.  Caption 2:  Unemployed veterans began demanding that money in 1932, so desperate was their need. From every part of the U.S. veterans started marching on Washington in May. The first group left from Portland, Oregon. Along the way thousands joined in. ""Heroes in 1917-Bums in 1932"" was one of the signs carried. Several thousand arrived in Cleveland where they took over the railroad yards until given a freight train to take them to Washington.  Caption 3:  It was June when the marchers reached the capitol. By the middle of the month 25,000 Bonus Marchers, many wives and children, were encamped across the Potomac at Anacostia Flats. Packing cases, holes in the ground, tents were their dwellings. And as they camped their numbers grew with arrivals from the other parts of the country. The Hoover Administration was terrified.

Led by cavalry, steel-helmeted troops, guns drawn, and some with sabres swinging; advanced on the bonus marchers. Pennsylvania Avenue was the first battleground. When the street was cleared, the troops advanced on Anacostia Flats where the vets had built their shantytown. Tear gas was thrown, the packing-case barricades stormed, the enemy was routed.

Home and farm foreclosures were commonplace. The Republicans renominated Hoover who promised more of the same pro-big business government. The Democrats chose New York's Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Caption 2:  While Roosevelt said he favored putting people back to work, there was little specific in his program. But by the time he took office in March, 1933 demands for specifics were overpowering. The financial crisis was so great that banks by the thousands were ordered closed. There was no money for wages, for honoring checks, schools closed, cities ran out of funds. Corporations began issuing their own money.  Caption 3:  Roosevelt ordered all banks in the country closed as soon as he took office and stabilization measures were worked out for them.

Caption 1:  The first six years of the Roosevelt Administrations, 1933-1939, saw many innovations as far as labor was concerned. First came the National Industrial Recovery Act which recognized labor's right to organize and bargain collectively and required employers to obey maximum hours of work and minimum rates of pay as approved by the President under industry codes. The codes called for a 40-hour week and minimum wages at $15 a week or 40 cents an hour.  Caption 2:  But the right to organize was later incorporated into the Wagner Act under which industrial unions swept the country. In 1933 over 900,000 workers struck, three times as many as the year before. Since the NRA did not distinguish between unions, and even favored company unions, the employers pushed these and in a short time there were 2,500,000 in company unions. In 1934 a National Labor Relations Board was set up.  Caption 3:  A great many of the strikes, about a third, in 1934 were for union recognition. Although millions were pleading for organization, the AFL leaders sat tight insisting on their old craft unionism and ignoring the great mass production industries such as auto, steel, electrical.

The LaFollette Senate Committee study estimated that starting in 1934 corporations spent $80 million a year for spies and associated measures to destroy unions. This paid for an estimated 100,000 labor spies.  Caption 2:  Engaged by 230 detective agencies these spies were reported to have wormed their way into every local union in the country. Union plans were reported to the corporations, union members' names turned over to the bosses for firing. General Motors admitted that it spent $419,850 with the Pinkerton spy agency between Jan., 1934 and July, 1936 and more than another half million with other agencies.

Thousands of spies had been hired by 2,500 corporations. They recruited union members who were then fired by the employers.  Caption 2:  The spies also helped promote violence. Companies assembled armies of professional strikebreakers from among criminals and armed them. Arsenals of guns and munitions were created to use on workers during the strikes. It was found that General Motors alone spent $830,000 between 1933 and 1936 for such illegal purposes. Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co. had 8 machine guns, 369 rifles, 190 shotguns, 109 gas guns on hand.  Caption 3:  Sen.

Caption 1:  Accompanying the tear gas, the guns and the labor spies as union-busting tools in the mid 1930's was the Mohawk Valley Formula. The name referred to the area in central New York state where the Remington Rand Corp. had its big plants. Company Pres. James Rand Jr., developed a strike-breaking plan which depended on convincing the community that red agitators were behind a strike.  Caption 2:  Groups of citizens would then be organized into ""vigilante"" groups to raid union halls, assault strike leaders and to seek out some workers to become scabs in ""back-to-work"" movements. Small businessmen were pressured into joining the vigilantes on the threat that otherwise the company would leave the area. Picket lines would be attacked by armed men under police protection.  Caption 3:  The Mohawk Valley Formula was promoted nationally by the National Association of Manufacturers. Used successfully against the Remington Rand workers at first, the scheme later suffered a major setback when UE organized them. In some states union enemies set up the Black Legion, This originated in the Michigan auto centers. Wearing black masks, its members were armed with whips and revolvers.

Caption 1:  Many industries were unorganized for the most part in the 1930's. Among these were the steel, maritime, electrical, rubber and auto industries. The old AFL unions had no interest in organizing them as the bureaucrats at their head feared to lose control if too many members came in. They had their deals with employers, collected enough dues to support themselves in high style and lived the ""good life."" Racketeering was common among such make-believe union leaders.  Caption 2:  For years the Intl. Longshoremen's Union was dominated by Pres. Joseph P. Ryan, notorious for his gangster associations. Tens of thousands of unorganized longshoremen started flocking into the union throughout California, Oregon and Washington ports in 1933. But they held on to rank and file control. The same was happening among West Coast seamen who were organizing into an independent union. When the employers refused to negotiate, both groups struck in May, 1934.  Caption 3:  The entire West Coast's shipping industry was halted by the strike of 35,000. Instigated by the Industrial Assn., San Francisco police launched an all-out war on the strikers. The press ran headlines such as ""Red Army Marching on City."" Pres. Ryan came from New York to denounce the strike as a red plot. All of San Francisco labor rallied behind the strikers and a general strike of 127,000 swept the city. Tear gas and assaults by masses of police with guns drawn were common.

Caption 1:  It was the brutal assault of police and 2,000 fully armed National Guardsmen on the waterfront strikers that convinced San Francisco labor that it would have to come out on a general strike. On July 5, 1934, the full force of city and state were turned on the strikers. Two workers were killed, hundreds severely injured as the police and Guardsmen with bayonets did the bidding of the employers.  Caption 2:  Disregarding telegrams from AFL Pres. William Green, local union after local union voted for a general strike in protest against the assault. By July 15 about 160 unions had taken this action. Every union, with the exception of the typographical and powerhouse, struck on July 16. The city was at a total  standstill. Three thousand troops were sent in by the state on top of the 2,000 already on duty.  Caption 3:  Gangs of vigilantes were organized by the employers to wreck union halls, smash clubrooms of foreign born workers, wreck bookstores where material favoring the strikers was to be had. The police arrested 500 unemployed on grounds that they were communist conspirators. All of them were soon released as having no connection with the strike or any political group. For several days not even a restaurant was open.

Caption 1:  Three days after the San Francisco general strike had started in protest against assaults on the maritime strikers, the AFL central body voted to end it, 191 to 174. But the police and National Guard attacks on the maritime strikers had come to an end. And when negotiations were over the longshoremen had won a 6-hour day, 30-hour week, time and a half for overtime as well as the end of the notorious shape-up.  Caption 2:  Now they had the hiring hall run by the union. This marked an end to the racketeering and the gangsterism with which the officials of the Intl. Longshoremen's Assn. had long maintained control over the waterfront. The Intl. Seamen's Union was recognized as spokesman for the seamen. In this strike there rose a new waterfront leader, Harry Bridges, who was elected head of the ILA local and then president of the West Coast District.  Caption 3:  The West Coast strike was a big step towards the coming national organizing drive. Hundreds of thousands were seeking union protection. But the AFL kept its doors closed, admitted some into federal local unions which were bureaucratic dues collection agencies and insisted on ignoring the mass production industries. Although 35 million were eligible for unions, AFL and independents had only a little over 3 1/2 million members.

Caption 1:  The tremendously successful longshore-maritime strikes on the West Coast, was new proof that labor was ready for the biggest organizing drive ever seen. Although the Roosevelt Administration had enacted the National Recovery Act (NRA) which granted workers the right to bargain collectively, this had resulted mainly in a great increase in company unions and in AFL federal local unions.  Caption 2:  By 1935, however, over 600 of the federal locals had fallen apart. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, held NRA to be unconstitutional. Hourly wages in the electrical industry averaged 50 cents; a weekly pay check of $10 was common. The issue was squarely before the Oct. 1935 convention of the AFL in Atlantic City. On one side stood the big craft union moguls such as Hutcheson of the Carpenters, Pres. Green, Matthew Woll, and John Frey.  Caption 3:  The debate over whether the AFL should permit industrial organization raged with Mineworkers' Pres. John L. Lewis demanding immediate action. With dramatic suddenness the frustrated Lewis strode to where the hidebound  ""Big"" Bill Hutcheson, 300 pounds of him, stood speaking, let go with his fist and connected. Hutcheson hit the floor. The fight made nationwide headlines. Industrial unionism was being born right there.

Caption 1:  A few weeks after John L. Lewis knocked Carpenters' Union Pres. Hutcheson to the floor with a punch, the leaders of ten AFL unions met to form a Committee for Industrial Organization. They were disgusted with the AFL convention's decision to again postpone organization of the big mass production industries. And before Nov. 1935 was over, Lewis announced his resignation as vice president of the AFL.  Caption 2:  When the AFL Executive Council met in Jan. 1936, it had before it a demand for industrial union charters in the radio, steel, rubber and auto industries-all almost totally unorganized. The hidebound Council countered, instead with demands that the CIO disband on the ground that it was a dual organization promoting rebellion against the parent organization.  Caption 3:  When warnings to disband were treated with contempt by the ten members of the new committee, the Executive Council suspended those unions. When the AFL convention met at Tampa, Fla. in the fall, there were no delegates from the ten unions who were associated with the Committee for Industrial Organization.

Caption 1:  The members of the ten-man Committee on Industrial Organization included the presidents of the Typographical, Hat, Oil, Mine, Ladies Garment, Textile and Amalgamated Clothing Workers. Some of these fell away when the going got rough; when they found that industrial organization could not be controlled the way their old bureaucratic set-ups were. The CIO started organizing unions where none existed.  Caption 2:  Opposed to the drive were men like Dan Tobin, president of the Teamsters, who called the workers in the mass-production industries ""rubbish;"" Matthew Woll of the Photoengravers who was also president of an anti-labor employer organization, the National Civic Federation and John Frey, of the AFL Metal Trades Dept. who had dedicated himself to stopping mass organization of labor.  Caption 3:  The new Committee for Industrial Organization aroused such enthusiasm among workers that millions streamed into the new unions. Hardly a year had passed and the CIO had passed the AFL in membership. At the end of 1937, the new group had 3,700,000 members; the old AFL 3,400,000. The AFL leaders had said these people could not be organized, were not worth organizing.

Caption 1:  The ten original unions which made up the Committee for Industrial Organization soon had new unions in the radio, rubber, glass, steel, auto industries. Instead of accepting this great historic fact, the old bureaucrats who ran the AFL launched an expulsion campaign. Every affiliate of the Industrial organizing committee was ordered expelled from city and state federations.  Caption 2:  By the end of 1937, the Committee for Industrial Organization had 37 affiliates. The AFL accused this new body of being communist controlled, a charge which some 12 years later, the CIO was to level at its own militant organizations in a later expulsion drive. The employers fought the CIO with slogans such as ""Join the CIO and Build a Soviet America."" A pamphlet with that title was widely circulated by the NAM.   Caption 3:  The new labor movement gave birth to a brand new tactic--the sit-in. Faced by brutal police, militia and gangster assaults on picket lines, working people in a number of newly organized industries decided to stay inside the factories refusing to come out until the employers agreed to negotiate. It happened first at Firestone Tire Plant No.1, Akron, Ohio on Jan. 29, 1936 when the night shift at 2 a.m. pulled the switch.

Food was sent in to them by their families. After three days and nights they had won a pay increase and other demands. The AFL had said such workers could not be organized. Before a year had passed close to half a million working people had been in sit-down strikes.  Caption 2:  And many were singing a song written by Detroit Attorney Maurice Sugar: When they tie the can to a union man, Sit down! Sit down! When they give him the sack, they'll take him back, Sit down! Sit down! When the speed-up comes, just twiddle your thumbs, Sit down! Sit down! When the boss won't talk, don't take a walk, Sit down!

Caption 1:  Before the CIO was organized as a labor federation, the new industrial unions had already been through several history-making battles. There was the victorious sitdown of Rubber Workers at Akron, the Auto Workers sitdown at Flint, and the greet UE strike against RCA at Camden, N. J. The RCA strike was the biggest labor battle in the summer of 1936 which saw working people the country over fighting to organize.  Caption 2:  Union forces in the electrical industry were small in 1936. But there were big national corporations like RCA, General Electric and Westinghouse. UE had been organized in March of that year. Small federal local unions, affiliated with the AFL and independent unions had come together with much more courage than funds to take on the electrical industry giants, its low wages, its lack of paid holidays, regular vacations and contractual job protections.  Caption 3:  A delegation of Camden, N. J. RCA workers came to the Rockefeller Center, N. Y. offices of Pres. Sarnoff of the company. They wanted recognition of their new union. But Sarnoff told them: ""I won't negotiate under this kind of pressure. I won't negotiate with a gun at my head."" Sarnoff claimed that John L. Lewis had promised him there would be no strike.

Lewis had pledged there would be no strike. Getting into a car, the unionists drove all night to a small Pennsylvania coal mining town to check with Lewis. The miners' leader denied any such promise.   Caption 2:  Word went back to Camden and the next morning 6,000 RCA workers were out. This was the beginning of one of the toughest battles in labor history. Before it was over RCA was to have spent $244,390, according to a research organization, to fight the UE. About half of this was paid out to a notorious detective agency which hired scabs, armed thugs, criminals to attack the strikers.  Caption 3:  The thugs were associated with state troopers, and 1,000 city police who were just as devoted to the RCA cause of stopping unionism. Bail for the arrested 175 strikers added up to $2 million. The hospitals received a steady, almost daily, stream of battered and beaten strikers.

Caption 1:  UE's first big victory, at RCA, in 1936 was shortly to be followed by new advances by other working people in other industries. The auto industry had long been known for its speedup built around the so-called belt system of production. Although wages were as low as 20 cents an hour in the auto industry, employers worked their men until they dropped. During an intense mid-summer heat wave that year Detroit ambulances were kept busy carrying collapsed workers to the hospitals.  Caption 2:  Workers had no control over the piece work rates. As soon as they met the standards, the time-study men would be in to raise the quotas. There were no unions and the manufacturers were ruthless in their determination to keep unions out. At the Ford plant in Dearborn, Mich.a widespread spy system operated under the notorious Harry Bennett to seek out any union supporters and to fire them.  Caption 3:  General Motors had its own anti-union schemes including the Black Legion, a hooded organization similar to the Ku Klux Klan, which engaged in outright murder to discourage workers from joining unions. The newspapers, the radio stations, school officials, even religious leaders in such auto towns as Flint, Mich. were all engaged in fighting the corporation rear-guard attack on unions.

Now, in the fall, auto workers who had had every one of their organizing efforts smashed in previous years, took hold of the sit-down tactic. Within a few months sit-down strikes against speedup and refusal to discuss grievances broke out in a number of General Motors plants. The company refused to negotiate with the union.  Caption 2:  Take up your grievance with the plant management, national GM Vice Pres. Knudsen replied in every case. On Dec. 28 the Cleveland GM workers halted production and refused to leave the plant. UAW Vice Pres. Wyndham Mortimer said they would stay there until the company agreed to meet the union nationally. Two days later the major GM plant at Flint, Mich. was stopped by a sit-down.  Caption 3:  A few days later the huge GM set-up including Atlanta, Ga., Anderson, Ind., Norwood, O., and Kansas City, were closed by the sit-down strikers. Outside the plants, particularly in Flint, the company was organizing a vigilante group to attack the strikers. Inside, the union members set up their committees to provide themselves with food, to police themselves, to organize entertainment.

Continuing the General Motors strike, the workers fought off  violence from policemen. Caption 1:  Outside the auto plants there were huge picket lines including the wives and children of the men sitting inside the GM plants. For 44 days these men occupied the plant in Flint, Mich. They slept on floors, in partly- completed cars. They pledged not to leave until General Motors recognized their union. GM got a court to issue an injunction ordering the strikers to leave. On appeal it was shown that the judge was a GM stockholder. This injunction was thrown out.  Caption 2:  Another injunction was secured. The strikers ignored it. Came the day when the police decided to bar the wives from  delivering food to their striking husbands. Armed with tear gas and guns, the police surrounded the pickets. They fired point blank into the crowd and threw gas bombs through the doors of Fisher Body Plant No. 2. The strikers were ready and answered with a barrage of iron bolts, car parts, pop bottles, coffee mugs. They turned the fire hoses on the bombs, on the police.  Caption 3:  ""The battle of the running bulls"" the men got to calling their victory over the police. The frightened corporation convinced the governor to call out the militia. When the company ordered the heat shut off to freeze the men out, the strikers warned that they would open the windows and let the fire-fighting equipment freeze resulting in cancellation of the company's fire insurance policies.

While being threatened with military intervention, the strikers remained in the plant and negotiations were still occurring between GM and the CIO.

Sloan said they were out to ""Sovietize"" the auto industry and then the whole country. Michigan Rep. Clare Hoffman called for shooting the strikers. Union members from all over the midwest converged on the Chevrolet and Fisher Body plants at Flint, Mich. to help protect those inside.  Caption 2:  Still the company refused to abide by the Wagner Act and negotiate that winter of 1937. When those inside the plants heard that Gov. Murphy was being pressured to use the troops to drive them out, they declared on the 10th day of the sit-in that they would fight. The governor, on the spot, called John L. Lewis, head of the CIO and the company officials to meet with him. But the corporation heads refused to budge from their ""no collective bargaining"" position.  Caption 3:  A month passed and still the plants were occupied by the strikers. On the 40th day the strikers wired the governor to tell him that the city of Flint, the sheriff, the judges-all belong to GM. They added that they waited to see whether the governor did, too, and warned him that they would not retreat; if they died resisting military assault he would be held responsible.

On the 44th day of the strike one of the most powerful corporations in the United States admitted defeat and announced its readiness to recognize the rights of its employees to engage in collective bargaining.  Caption 2:  It was hard for men who had been inside the Chevrolet plants for well over a month to realize that they were about to go home. But the union leaders gave the word and the factory whistles blew. Gathering up their sox, extra shirts and underwear into bundles, the auto strikers marched out to be met by thousands of other workers and members of their families. They formed into a parade and marched through the streets of Flint.  Caption 3:  Fisher body plant No. 1 strikers marched to Plant No. 2 where they were joined by strikers coming out of there. Their first union contract brought the workers raises of 30 cents and 40 cents an hour. Auto industry wages rose by $300,000,000 in one year and the union's membership increased from 30,000 members to 500,000 in that year.

Caption 1:  The smashing victory over the General Motors Corp. was the start of a vast organizing campaign in the previously, almost totally, unorganized auto industry. Meanwhile similarly unorganized workers in the electrical, maritime, transport, steel and other industries were building their organizations. In 1919 a large group of AFL craft unions had been brought into a steel organizing drive under the leadership of William Z. Foster and John Fitzpatrick.  Caption 2:  That effort had been smashed by thugs, police, militia, and finally, the inability and unwillingness of the craft unions to stick together. Now, in 1937, a Steel Workers Organizing Committee was set up. It called on veteran mine worker organizers, on some who had had experience in the 1919 fiasco, on old time steel workers, regardless of political views, to unite to smash the opposition of the steel corporations to unions.  Caption 3:  Besides the paid organizers some 5,000 volunteered to help the SWOC. Tremendous fear had to be overcome as the steelworkers recalled the old terror, the blacklists. With the workers' victory at GM fresh in the country's mind, the chairman of the United States Steel Corp. accepted John L. Lewis' bid for union recognition. But the big battle was still to come. The so-called Little Steel companies were stockpiling munitions, assembling armed men, spies to fight off the  forthcoming union bid at Youngstown Sheet, Inland Steel and Republic Steel.

Caption 1:  While U.S. Steel Corp. signed a union agreement with The Steel Workers Organizing Committee in 1937, the so-called ""Little Steel"" companies prepared to fight the new union. They stockpiled machine guns, rifles, tear gas, bombs. According to the LaFollette Committee of the Senate, the companies spent close to $44,000 for the munitions. In May of that year the munitions were put to use against 75,000 strikers.  Caption 2:  Armed company thugs and the police opened fire on steel workers at Youngstown, Massilon and Cleveland, Ohio. And people died. At least 17 were killed and the wounded went to more than 150. But the big battle came at South Chicago where a peaceful march of 300 Republic Steel strikers on Memorial Day were surprised by armed police. At the head of the parade were signs reading: ""Come on Out, Help Win the Strike,"" ""Republic vs. the People.""  Caption 3:  The paraders were attacked and men and women fell before the firing guns. Tear gas grenades blinded those not yet hit and charging police came rushing in to complete the job with swinging nightsticks and baseball bats. The unarmed workers answered with stones before fleeing. There were ten dead to pick up and over 100 injured. About 20 police had been slightly injured.

Caption 1:  The Memorial Day Massacre in which peaceful steel strikers were murdered by steel corporation gunmen shocked the country. The conspiracy to destroy unionism through force and violence showed Americans the real nature of big business. Instead of the labor movement being stopped it expanded at a quicker rate. Republic Steel and the other Little Steel companies had to recognize the union. Steelworkers won a 40-hour week.  Caption 2:  The senate was stimulated to investigate the spy-thug set-ups in the service of industry. Within months the Committee for Industrial Organization, an offshoot of the old AFL, grew from affiliated unions with a membership of 1,000,000 to twice that number. Then again to 3,000,000 as new unions were coming into existence. And the number went up to almost 4,000,000.  Caption 3:  By 1938 the baby industrial union set-up found it necessary to establish a more permanent organization. A convention was called to establish the Congress of Industrial Organizations. Unlike the old AFL, the new unions assured the working people that no one would be barred regardless of ""sex, race, creed or national origin.""

Caption 1:  Among the least organized industries in the United States in the 1930's was the electrical industry. While the radio industry was fairly new (television, of course, non-existent) electrical machinery and electric light bulb manufacture was of quite substantial size. Earlier organizing efforts in the big GE and Westinghouse companies had been smashed by the Wall Street-run corporations.  Caption 2:  At Westinghouse, for example, a strike for the 8-hour day in 1916 had been broken when the company called in troops and bombarded the community with wild charges about the subversive character of the East Pittsburgh Westinghouse workers. In 1935 several independent unions and AFL federal labor unions set up the Radio and Allied Trades Council and applied for an AFL national charter.  Caption 3:  The old-line AFL craft unions feared the power of the rising industrial union movement. They rejected the appeal of the group. The Machinists Union had its private empire; the IBEW its own. Moulders groups, toolmaker groups and others stood in the way of industrial unionism. The Radio Council was advised to disband and turn over its members to the existing unions. They refused and called a national convention.

Caption 1:  Buffalo, N.Y. was the city to which representatives of local unions wanting to organize the electrical and radio industry were called. This call was answered by 44 delegates on March 21, 1936. Some of these delegates came from Federal locals of the AFL, that is local unions which were not connected with any International unions and were controlled directly by the AFL Executive Council. There were also delegates from independent, not company, unions.  Caption 2:  The 44 delegates at this first meeting represented 30,000 workers. Among their decisions was the establishment of a national industrial union which, was to have a weekly newspaper for every member. Two national officers, twelve regional vice presidents, four full-time organizers and a defense fund were also approved. The new union was to be called the United Electrical & Radio Workers of America.  Caption 3:  As arranged at the Buffalo session, the new union met in Convention again in the fall, at Fort Wayne, Ind., in Sept., 1936. Eight new locals had been organized with thousands of new members since the Buffalo meeting. But employer resistance to unions was at its height. The Wagner Act which established the National Labor Relations Board was still being fought in the courts by the employers.

Caption 1:  The heart of the new industrial union in the electrical and radio industry was a constitution which established the right of every worker in the industry ""regardless of craft, age, sex, nationality, race or creed or political beliefs"" to belong to it. Possibly with the exception of age, there were unions which had discriminated against workers, or barred them from membership on every one of these grounds.  Caption 2:  Most unions of the American Federation of Labor organized only within a craft even when a large plant had a majority outside the craft. Consequently, most workers especially in the major industries remained unorganized or if there were more than one craft in a plant, each group was in a separate union, belonging to a separate international. Naturally, instead of unity there was disunity perpetuated by the unions themselves.  Caption 3:  Frequently, the craft unions barred workers who were not white or countenanced control of jobs by a single nationality through admitting only the sons of fathers in the trade. Accepting or even insisting on the employer limiting women to the lowest paid, least skilled operations also helped keep workers divided. And then there were unions which imposed political censorship on the members. The UE constitution smashed through all these divisions.

Caption 1:  Although the Congress of Industrial Organization was having amazing success in organizing the millions of unorganized workers, its leaders proposed to meet with the leaders of the American Federation of Labor in the fall of 1937 to see whether the two organizations could be united. The AFL, however, proposed to destroy the CIO by having the ten original unions return to it and the newly formed ones such as the UE negotiate terms for admission.  Caption 2:  This would have meant dismemberment of the new industrial unions among the craft unions which had for so long refused to organize the ""riffraff,"" as some of them described the masses of industrial workers not in the skilled crafts. A series of conferences between leaders of both federations failed to resolve the differences. The CIO delegation insisted on the right of every one of its affiliates entering the AFL as a unit.  Caption 3:  Otherwise, UE for example, would have been cannibalized by a number of unions including the IBEW, the Polishers, the Moulders, the Pattern Makers, the Plumbers, the Steamfitters and the carpenters all of which claimed jurisdiction in the electrical and radio industry. Other of the new unions, there were 22 of them, would have become victims of the same divisive butchery. The AFL leaders' proposal for disunity was rejected.

Caption 1:  How right the decision of the CIO unions, including UE, was in insisting on protecting industrial unionism was soon proven in life. Within four years the new movement had close to four million members. The enthusiasm generated by this movement, led in many instances by young people, carried over even into the AFL and into independent unions so that by 1940 the total number of  organized workers had tripled.   Caption 2:  Black workers, recent immigrants, women workers, young workers who didn't have the skills entitling them to craft union membership were added to the ranks of organized labor, especially in the CIO unions. There were 200,000 electrical workers now organized; 375,000 steel workers; 100,000  agricultural and packing workers; 400,000 automobile workers and the coal miners union soared to 600,000.  Caption 3:  Growing strong in industry, working people began thinking in terms of independent political action. Among the expressions of this was the American Labor Party in New  York, the Farmer-Labor Party in Minnesota, the Washington Commonwealth Federation on the West Coast. These movements gave powerful support to the New Deal program, prodded the politicians to move forward, supported the best of them and ran their own candidates.

Caption 1:  The very first UE convention, in March 1936, had laid out as union goals the organization of the General Electric plant at Schenectady, N. Y.; the Westinghouse plant at East Pittsburgh, Pa.; RCA at Camden, N. J. and the General Motors' Frigidaire plant at Dayton, Ohio. These were monumental tasks, yet by 1940, the new industrial union had gone far beyond these goals.  Caption 2:  Some of the successes came only after bitter strikes such as at RCA and Emerson Electric in St. Louis. At the latter plant the workers went through a 55 day strike before the company would agree to a union contract. At GE, there had been a company practice of sponsoring company unions. Called Works Councils, these included management representatives.  Caption 3:  After the election of President Franklin D. Roosevelt the right of workers to form their own organizations was confirmed by the government. GE removed its representatives from the Schenectady company union and changed its name to Workers' Council. UE supporters joined this group to help swing it towards real unionism. By the end of 1936, UE challenged the Workers' Council in a Labor Board election and won.

Caption 1:  Having succeeded in organizing the main plant of the General Electric Co. at Schenectady, N. Y., the new UE continued with the drive to bring the main plant of Westinghouse, the second largest electrical corporation, into its ranks. As at Schenectady, UE supporters at the East Pittsburgh Westinghouse plant had joined the existing company union and in 1936 succeeded in winning five of the six posts on its executive committee.  Caption 2:  By the following spring, UE Local 601 was able to submit 7,200 membership cards to the Labor Board and won certification as the plant's collective bargaining representative. The company union's executive committee approved the NLRB decision. Within the space of a single year the two biggest plants of the two largest electrical corporations in the country had been swung into a union which hadn't existed two years earlier.  Caption 3:  At the union's founding convention at Buffalo in March 1936, there had been delegates from an independent local union at the GE plant at Lynn, Mass.; and AFL federal locals at the Springfield, Mass. Westinghouse plant and the Fort Wayne, Ind. GE plant. The federal locals had existed since 1933. At the South Philadelphia Westinghouse plant there was, also, an AFL federal local union which had been recognized by the company but it had no written contract.

Caption 1:  Seven years had elapsed since the outbreak of the worst economic crisis in U.S. history when UE and other CIO unions were bringing organization to millions of unorganized workers in 1936. Various government programs had created jobs for millions of unemployed on public works, in the building of homes, in creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority for public power and flood control.  Caption 2:  But large numbers of workers remained unemployed. For the employers this pool of unemployed was a weapon they used to depress the working conditions of those fortunate enough to have jobs. The employers and their organizations fought the government public works' programs, said they were steps towards socialism, boondoggling operations and the workers employed on them just ""leaning on their shovels.""  Caption 3:  Initially the heavy unemployment tended to discourage workers from joining unions but speedup and wage cuts made workers realize that they needed unions. In 1938 the UE organized 28 plants including GE plants, Allis Chalmers, Singer Sewing Machine, American Machine & Foundry, about 30,000 workers. At the first CIO convention that year, Pres. John L. Lewis cited the UE achievements, including the first national agreement with GE as evidence of CIO accomplishments.

Caption 1:  The economic depression which had hit the United States in 1929 had also hit hard at the other western industrial nations including Great Britain, Germany, Italy, and Spain. Many millions of people starved. Huge corporations went bankrupt, major banks collapsed dragging down entire nations and revealing widespread governmental corruption which had contributed to bringing about the worst economic crisis the world had ever seen.   Caption 2:  Wherever working people began demanding relief from the terrible conditions through their unions and in vast new political movements, big business financed organizations and leaders to smash the labor organizations and political movements which represented the people. The German monopolies financed Hitler's Nazi movement which used brutal terror and race hatred to smash the German labor movement.   Caption 3:  German fascism became the source of anti-democratic infection which swept across Europe. When the Spanish people established their first democratic government in 1936, a clique of militarists led by Gen. Franco gained the support of Hitler and the Italian fascist leader Mussolini in waging a bloody three year war to overthrow the Spanish government. The new CIO was deeply concerned over these developments.

Caption 1:  Labor movements in Europe which appealed to the CIO and its affiliates for help and solidarity in resisting the anti-democratic forces won a sympathetic response. The new unions feared that the violence which was being used to smash workers' organizations abroad would find a ready acceptance by the corporations here who saw in the new labor movement a threat to their exploitation of working people.  Caption 2:  In strike after strike, violence was a major weapon turned on the workers by the employers. State troops, hired thugs, paid stool pigeons were all part of the employer counter-offensive. Along with the violence went a massive effort to persuade workers that the industrial union movement was part of a red plot to overthrow the United States government and financed from abroad.  Caption 3:  The Roosevelt Administration with its social security, minimum wage laws, and federal job programs; the movements in support of the victims of fascism in Europe; the new industrial unions were all seen as threats by the big corporations which had brought the country to economic collapse after years of profiteering and widespread governmental corruption on behalf of those corporations.

Caption 1:  Along with the development of the industrial unions and the struggles of the unemployed through their councils and alliances, there was a parallel development of independent political action by working people. Other sections of the population including farmers and professionals who were inspired by the new labor movement's militant stand joined in helping to build various forms of independent political action.  Caption 2:  Some of the new independent political movements of the 1930's emphasized support of the candidates and policies of the Roosevelt administration. Others leaned towards developing their own political platforms, often more radical than the administration's, and presented the voters with their own candidates. Such independent political action, whatever the form, helped overcome conservative or employer pressure on the government.  Caption 3:  Among the independent political movements which won extensive support, electing many state and national legislators, mayors and governors, were the American Labor Party in New York State; the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party; the Washington Commonwealth Federation. Such movements pushed the legislative interests of working people and fought anti-labor groups such as the Black Legion, and Silver Shirts, modeled after Hitler's Nazi gangs.

Caption 1:  Built on the principle that all workers, regardless of race, creed, sex or political belief were to be organized, the unions of the CIO continued to make sweeping organizational gains. The UE, for example, in 1941 was able to renew its national contract with GE, negotiate the first national agreement with Westinghouse, add 116,000 members to its ranks and win wage increases estimated at over $63 million. The UE's organizational campaigns and contract negotiations were coordinated with other CIO unions.  Caption 2:  But the drive for world conquest which impelled Adolph Hitler was, at the same time, entering its final stages. After helping Gen. Franco destroy the Spanish republic, the German fascist leader invaded country after country in Europe and launched aerial warfare against Britain in an attempt to soften that country up for invasion. In the summer of 1941, the German armies attacked the Soviet Union. Six months later, Japan, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States.  Caption 3:  With the Soviet armies offering strong resistance in the east, Britain holding up Nazi invasion plans in the west and the United States building up its might for eventual full scale participation in the fight against fascist aggression, American labor pledged full strength to victory.

Caption 1:  As millions of men entered the armed forces, women swarmed into the factories to produce the materials needed for fighting the war. Many jobs formerly denied women  were opening to them. But if employers had to hire women to keep the factories going, they were not under equal pressure to grant them equal pay for the work men had been doing. This was to become a major issue, especially, for the UE which began to build a case for government action.  Caption 2:  While working people were going all out to help defeat fascism, industry was going all out to take advantage of the emergency to swell its profits. Prices soared as consumer goods including food, clothing and other basic necessities became short of supply due to conversion of civilian industry to military production. Workers seeking wage increases to help overcome inflation, found government officials ready to help industry keep wages down.  Caption 3:  Although a price control law was enacted, federal officials in charge of enforcement were vary lax in doing so. Instead, they pressured the National War Labor Board to reject any substantial wage increases negotiated by the unions. As always workers' wages, were regarded as ""inflationary"" but not profits.

Caption 1:  While many of the suggestions that came out of the labor movement's determination to help the anti-fascist coalition win the war dealt with converting industry to war production, some were of a different nature. The textile labor advisory committee, for example, proposed style changes which would save 100 million yards of fabric. These included elimination of women's three piece dress and suit combinations, shorter dresses, skirts and coats. Also, elimination of belts, pockets and flaps on slacks.  Caption 2:  In renewing the national contract with the Westinghouse company in 1942, the UE won agreement that women placed on jobs performed by men before the U.S. entry into the war would be paid the same rate of pay as men. Also, women were given a larger wage increase in order to reduce the differential between men and women that the corporation had long enforced. Here and in the contract signed with GE that year, the union gained maintenance of membership clauses.  Caption 3:  The UE's insistence on making the principle of equal pay for equal work a basic part of its collective bargaining program led to the National War Labor Board adopting that principle in ruling on cases before it. It was a case brought before it by the UE involving the Norma Hoffman Company that established equal pay for women as NWLB policy. This was then added to other contracts negotiated by the union.

Caption 1:  In the battlefields of World War II, the three major opponents of Hitler's Nazi armies were the United States, Great Britain and the Soviet Union. Domestically, the big industrial unions of the CIO, formed only a few years earlier, were a powerful force backing up the anti-fascist coalition. Heading that domestic power were the CIO's ""big three,"" the UE, Steelworkers and Auto Workers.  Caption 2:  But while these and other unions were doing all within their power to further quick victory over fascism, big industry was viewing the war as a grand opportunity to make a big profit killing. Between 1940 and 1945, corporate profits were four and a half times what they had been from 1934 through 1939. This was reflected in a 45 percent wartime cost-of-living increase.  Caption 3:  This increase in the cost-of-living came despite price controls. Black market operators developed ways of beating the controls. Manufacturers of clothing and other necessities got around controls by substituting inferior materials or changing the makeup of their products. The addition of a button to a shirt, for example, could be an excuse to  describe it as a different product entitled to a higher price.

Caption 1:  The war which Hitler had begun in Europe in 1939 came to an end in May 1945 as the Red Army from the  East and the allied forces of the United States and Great Britain from the West, crushing the Nazi armies between them, met at the Elbe River in Germany. Full attention was turned to defeating Japan, the remaining member of the German-Italian-Japanese axis which had begun the war in the name of defeating communism.  Caption 2:  With the major part of the war over, U.S. employers, bloated with wartime profiteering, launched their offensive against working people. Mass layoffs of those who had produced the war goods, chiseling on wages and conditions which had already suffered heavily during the war was commonplace. The war-induced price increases were pressing down on living standards. Working people were preparing to fight back.  Caption 3:  The leadership of the big three of the CIO, the UE, Steelworkers and Auto Workers, began considering ways of responding to the needs of their members. Separately in their own union conferences and together in a beginning of common action, these unions began planning for a united fight against the most powerful corporations in the country.

One week later, 800,000 steel workers responded to the strike call of their union. A few weeks before the UE strike started, United Auto Worker members in the General Motors plants had gone on strike. This was the biggest coordinated strike movement in the history of the United States.  Caption 2:  The corporations, biggest in the country, had used the World War II emergency to gorge themselves on profit, taking advantage of the working people's determination to defeat fascism. They held down wages and undermined working conditions. Inspired by the actions of the ""big three"" of the labor movement, unions which had come into being only a decade before, tens of thousands of workers in other unions also struck.  Caption 3:  As monumental as was this unprecedented strike wave, was the outpouring of support for the strikers. Numerous city governments endorsed the UE strikes. Fifty-five U.S. senators and congressmen put their names to a public statement which said: ""UE strikers deserve full moral and financial support in their grim struggle for a substantial wage increase and for a decent American standard of living.""

Caption 1:  As January, 1946 drew to an end, there were some 1,500,000 workers on strike in the United States. The day after UE struck 73 GE, Westinghouse and GM electrical division plants, the CIO Packinghouse Workers shut down the five biggest corporations in the meat industry. The CIO Communications Workers struck Western Union. Even independent unions as that of 17,000 Western Electric workersin New Jersey were drawn into the struggle to recover wage losses incurred during World War II and to make some long deferred gains.  Caption 2:  Six hundred war veterans on strike at Pennsylvania GE and Westinghouse plants marched on the governor's office to demand unemployment insurance. Gov. Martin fled rather than face the workers who occupied the House of  Representatives room for a meeting with other officials. A group of upstate Farmers Union members contributed a heifer to GE strikers. Made desperate by the complete paralysis of their plants, and getting nowhere with attempts to hire scabs, the companies turned to violence.   Caption 3:  One of the most brutal attacks on strikers occurred on March 6, 1946 in Philadelphia as police threw themselves on a meeting of GE and Westinghouse strikers. The strikers had assembled seven blocks from the GE plant to protest a court injunction the company had gotten to break the picket lines. Dozens were clubbed to the ground and workers who sought refuge on porches in the area were followed and beaten there. An entire neighborhood was roped off as the police sought to terrorize strike sympathizers.

Caption 1:  Ten thousand Philadelphia citizens assembled at the city hall to denounce the March 6, 1946 police attack on GE and Westinghouse strikers. They demanded that the mayor call off the police. From all over the country came wires and calls backing the right of strikers to exercise the right to free speech and assembly. In several New Jersey cities the companies got court injunctions.  Caption 2:  In Bloomfield, N.J., a British law dating back to King Edward III, almost 900 years ago, was used as the basis for an injunction which authorized the sheriff to ""kill, hurt and wound"" the Westinghouse strikers, almost all young women. The sheriff recruited nearly 200 toughs, armed with clubs and guns to terrorize the strikers. A company lawyer acted as prosecutor against arrested strikers.  Caption 3:  Support for the strikers was so widespread that even the courts were affected. So, those union leaders arrested in New Jersey were acquitted. Hundreds of workers had demonstrated outside the court house, headed by three UE members dressed to represent the ""Spirit of '76"" of the American revolution.

Caption 1:  The first national strike against the General Electric Co lasted nine weeks, ending in March 1946 with 100,000 UE members winning an 18.5 cent hourly increase. Corporation-inspired violence, many arrests of strikers, and an expensive anti-union publicity campaign had failed to budge the strikers. One of the hindrances to settlement had been the insistence of GE Pres. Charles E. Wilson that the union accept a smaller increase for women whom he contemptuously called ""bobby soxers."" He failed.  Caption 2:  As the GE workers streamed back to work proud that they had beaten the biggest electrical corporation in the country,  Westinghouse still refused to come to terms. A New Jersey jury refused to convict five UE strike leaders at Westinghouse. Federal mediators upheld the union's position that the company   was offering a much smaller increase than GE had finally granted. The mediators scored the company and withdrew from  the case. The strike had started in January. Now it was April.   Caption 3:  GE had tried to split the workers by offering women a smaller increase. Now Westinghouse tried to split the workers by proposing to give no increase to lamp workers with 9.7 cents for the rest. Pennsylvania's Gov. Martin, who had refused to meet striking war veterans who had come to the state capitol, stationed state troopers around the company's East Pittsburgh plant to try to frighten the pickets. It didn't work. GE workers, back at work, joined in raising funds for the strikers, some giving a week's wage increase.

It was estimated by the union that the settlement added $40 million to the pay of Westinghouse employees, a very important contribution to a nation still trying to work itself out of World War II restrictions on earnings.  Caption 2:  But even as millions of workers scored tremendous victories behind the unity of the UE, Steelworkers and Auto Workers, the corporations had begun political war in Washington to take back what they had lost on the picket lines. During the war there had been some control over prices through the Office of Price Administration, OPA. Politicians serving the corporations decided to wipe out the price controls, an especially dangerous step in light of tremendous war-caused shortages of consumer goods.  Caption 3:  Many organizations, besides labor unions, rallied to the defense of price control warning that the alternative was runaway inflation. Representatives of organizations with 15 million members, including the Farmers Union, YWCA, and the General Federation of Women's Clubs joined the unions in testifying before a Senate Committee against House-approved amendments designed to cripple the already severely-weakened law which kept a lid on prices.

Caption 1:  As corporations pushed ahead to end wartime-enacted price controls, they began a battle on another political front. Shocked by their defeats on the picket lines in the first post-war strikes, big business moved to get legislation which would cripple collective bargaining and the right to strike. To soften up the public for such legislation, the corporations launched a nationwide drive picturing themselves as puny pigmies being oppressed by a power-mad labor giant.  Caption 2:  One bill proposed in Congress (by Sen. Case of New Jersey) provided for corporation suits against unions; repeal of the Norris-LaGuardia anti-injunction act; amendment of the Wagner Act which had established the right to organize and collective bargaining as government-protected rights. Coupled with this bill was a huge increase in funds for the House Committee on ""Un-American Activities."" Targets for this committee were the unions, and groups favoring independent political action.  Caption 3:  As the case bill went through Congress, 230,000 rail-road strikers were driven back to work through emergency legislation obtained by President Truman. The workers had sought an eight hour day and time-and-a-half for overtime. The President then proposed legislation drastically curbing the right to strike, legalized injunctions and empowered the selective service system to assume control over labor. The CIO called this ""involuntary servitude"" and urged vetoes of these bills.

Caption 1:  The employer rampage against working people following World War II was not limited to promoting legislation to cripple unions and to hamstring labor political action. There was violence, too. For example, UE members who struck the powerful Phelps Dodge plant in Elizabeth, N.J. found themselves facing a gang of thugs and scabs led by Tony Anastasia who had been in the news frequently for his connections with Murder, Inc. The respectable corporation coupled easily with society's dregs.  Caption 2:  Brought across the bay from Brooklyn, the scabs were housed in the plant. As the strike entered its eighth month, the desperate company turned its thugs loose. One striker was shot in the leg and Mario Russo, a member of UE at another plant who had joined the pickets in an act of solidarity was killed. He was only 27 years old, a three year veteran of World War II and father of four small children.  Caption 3:  While Russo lay dying in the hospital, the company finally recognized that the 2500 strikers would not be starved, clubbed or shot into giving up. Nine months after they had walked out in September, 1946, these courageous UE members went back to work with a signed contract. They got the 18.5 cent an hour raise it had taken GE workers eight weeks of strike and those at Westinghouse four months of strike to win.

Caption 1:  As 1946 came to an end, working people could look back on a year of tremendous victories over the most powerful corporations. Labor unity behind the industrial unions formed in 1935-36 had paid off. As big business went on to the counter-attack at home, it moved to reassert its full control of foreign affairs replacing the allied unity which had led to victory in World War II with the ""cold war"" of international tension and confrontation.   Caption 2:  Charles E. Wilson, president of General Electric had seen how his company's employees, united in UE, had taken GE's measure earlier in the year. Now, in October, 1946, Wilson described the position of his class: ""The problems of the United States can be summed up in two words: Russia abroad, labor at home."" If labor could be split at home and if all of it or major sections could be persuaded that not the profiteering corporations but the Russians were the ""problem"" the Wilson crowd would be in the driver's seat.  Caption 3:  When the CIO was formed in the mid 1930's, big business and its political stooges had labeled it a communist-inspired plot against America. There was even a corporation-inspired publication entitled ""Join the CIO and Build a Soviet America."" Now, the weapon of red-baiting was picked up again. By branding militant labor activity and opposition to cold war as communist inspired, the failure to stop the CIO from being born might be overcome, through wrecking it.

Eventually, that legislation became known as the Taft-Hartley law, superseding the Wagner Act which had been wrung out of the federal government at the height of the organizing drives of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, a decade earlier.  Caption 2:  The Wagner Act recognized workers' right to join unions. The Taft-Hartley law was designed to discourage workers from joining unions. It gave employers a free hand to disrupt union organizing drives; it produced a mass of regulations which entangled workers seeking organization; it contained for the first time in American history a section establishing political tests for union membership.  Caption 3:  Out of desire to protect themselves from the employers' attacks, out of a fear of militant rank and file unionism, or out of a corrupt desire to fatten their union treasuries by slicing chunks of membership out of other unions, many labor leaders joined the employer-politician campaign to wreck the CIO.

First those unions helped create the climate for passage of the anti-labor law by splitting the ranks of labor; then after denouncing the law they used it as a weapon to disorganize the organized.

As the anti-labor propaganda poured out of committee rooms, corporations stood ready to further the divisions in labor's ranks.

Workers in the electrical manufacturing industry who had, through UE, set the pace on wages, holidays, vacations and many other basic conditions were now falling behind the Steelworkers and the Auto Workers, two of the unions whose leaders led the attack on UE.

By the time this unprecedented assault had run its course, the aim of the corporations to weaken the UE had been gained.

Prodded by the cold-war politicians, encouraged by the employers, those leaders diverted their dwindling resources to efforts to destroy the ousted unions, even helping to set up rival unions, such as the IUE, with employer assistance.  Caption 2:  Workers in the electrical manufacturing industry were special targets of this cannibalistic drive because UE had become, in a short 10 years, a most successful spokesman for the economic and political rights of working people. Within a few years, these workers, who in 1946 had the power to humble the most powerful corporations, were reduced to accepting crumbs from those same corporations. The General Electric Co. boasted of its role in this development.  Caption 3:  Taking the offensive, GE hired Lemuel Boulware to conduct the campaign for eliminating unionism as an effective force. The company would present the various unions with a set of contract proposals, permit only some minor adjustments while waging a nationwide struggle to discourage and demoralize the employees.

The wartime chief of staff, the secretary of the army, fellow legislators, newspapermen who dared criticize him were among those dragged into his net of alleged subversives or tools of subversives. His statements received widespread publicity.  Caption 3:  The labor movement became a special target of McCarthy's. Big business recognized in him a handy tool with which to recover gains labor had made in the post-war strikes. It was difficult to attack working people for wanting a better life so employers resorted to an old device; condemn their struggles as ""communist-inspired."" It had been used against the 8-hour day movement, social security, and to maintain child labor.

Caption 1:  Typical of the employer efforts to equate trade union struggles with ""communism"" was an ""off the record"" meeting of the National Industrial Conference Board in Jan. 1951. Here, employers were advised by an army lieutenant colonel to fingerprint all employees, surround the plants with two rings of barbed wire, erect steel towers and place guards armed with rifles in them while plant gate guards should be provided with tear gas grenades.  Caption 2:  Additional advice given the employers present was to put informers among the workers who would report what literature was being distributed and what the workers were talking about. Robt. Denham, former head of the Natl. Labor Relations Board, described the Taft-Hartley law as an attempt to deal with communist infiltration in the labor movement. Denham revealed that while in the NLRB he had advised employers on how to fire union members, shop stewards or shop chairmen.  Caption 3:  When some of the employers present showed concern of being sued if a worker were fired, the recent government official replied: ""You can fire him for wearing a red necktie if you wish under our system. Only make sure that the Board can't say you fired him for union activity."" All this was part of the drive to scare workers into accepting whatever the employers did without protest. Employers were advised that city and state police departments would help them get information on employees they wanted to fire.

Caption 1:  The Taft-Hartley law having weakened unions, it became possible for the government to impose a wage freeze on workers in the early 1950's with the Korean war as the excuse. Negotiated vacations, holidays and wage increases were either cut out of thousands of agreements or radically reduced by the Wage Stabilization Board despite rising prices. Employers were reaping the economic benefits of the anti-labor law and the attacks on civil liberties.  Caption 2:  To further weaken labor's ability to resist employers, Sen. Robert Taft, co-sponsor of the law, prodded the Justice Dept. to prosecute labor leaders for not being in compliance with that law. When some government, officials protested that they didn't have the evidence to get convictions, the Ohio Republican replied: ""They may not be able to pin it on them, but they can catch some of them with a jury.""  Caption 3:  In 1953, freshman Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater proposed a bill requiring unions to be federally licensed. The terms of this proposed legislation were so harsh that a spokesman for the American Federation of Labor said that any union that ever proposed anything the Communist Party advocated,  including income taxes and public schools, could be put out of business. He and other labor spokesmen saw the bill as resembling what was done to labor in Germany by Adolph Hitler.

Caption 1:  The country was in a severe recession in 1954, following the end of the Korean War. Well over 4 million were unemployed. As UE took the lead in developing a program for jobs, the big electrical manufacturing corporations worked closely with the infamous Sen. Joe McCarthy to drive out of the factories any semblance of militant labor activity. As GE officials sat in the audience, the Wisconsin senator badgered a group of Schenectady, N.Y., GE workers on their political beliefs.  Caption 2:  Pres. Fitzgerald called the senator ""a willing tool of the General Electric Co.,"" recalling that McCarthy had  previously done the same act at the Lynn, Mass. plant on the eve of a Labor Board election in order to prevent the UE from regaining collective bargaining rights. Thousands of Schenectady GE workers demonstrated against the McCarthy hearings and from all over the country came angry protests against the attacks on workers' rights.  Caption 3:  When a black worker present at the hearings dared to clap at one point, McCarthy ordered two U.S. marshals to drag him to the witness stand. Instead of being cowed, the UE member, shouting above the gavel-pounding senator denounced ""your Ku Klux committee,"" and demanded to know why he didn't go after racist Senators Byrnes and Talmadge.

Caption 1:  The corporate-political hookup against militant unionists which hit at GE workers was being duplicated in other companies and other industries in 1953-54. While GE was firing workers who had been dragged before the McCarthy committee, Westinghouse was singling out as ""undesirable"" long-time employees who failed to satisfy the anti-labor House UnAmerican Activities Committee. Seamen, communications workers, auto workers and many others were being hit.  Caption 2:  While congressional committees continued to invade the major industrial centers to smash workers' ability to fight unemployment and employer anti-labor conspiracies, a barrelfull of bills was being pushed in Congress to establish nationwide blacklists of unions and union members. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce wrote that ""1954 may well be the last chance for a number of years"" for big business to tie up the labor movement's ability to resist employers.  Caption 3:  One bill, proposed by Atty.-Gen. Herbert Brownell, of Eisenhower's cabinet, and introduced by then Rep. Barry Goldwater, would have given the government the authority to dissolve unions, religious organizations, newspapers, radio stations or businesses on the pretext that they were ""communist-dominated.""

Joe McCarthy's so-called attacks on the ""communist menace"" spread beyond radical groups, trade unions, and liberals. He began going after the Democratic Party and his own Republican Party as helpers of the communist cause. Members of President Eisenhower's cabinet soon were being assailed for the same reason and finally, the U.S. Army leadership including World War II Chief of Staff Gen. Marshall.  Caption 2:  Many of those who had been willing to countenance McCarthy's wild-swinging attacks on radicals and liberals were frightened. Vermont Sen. Ralph Flanders, a liberal Republican, charged in a number of speeches that McCarthy was following a course parallel to Hitler's. Flanders recalled  that ""Hitler exploited the issue of communism,"" as the opening wedge in his drive for power.  Caption 3:  Flanders warned that McCarthy, like Hitler, aimed at destroying the free labor movement. He noted that McCarthy had defended the ""Nazi ruffians"" who massacred American prisoners of war in World War II. Flanders proposed that the Senate censure McCarthy.

Caption 1:  Even while there was growing recognition that Sen. Joe McCarthy was a menace to the country, President Eisenhower's Attorney-General Herbert Brownell pushed for a bill to require government licensing of labor unions. This, in effect, would give Washington the power to decree which unions workers could join. The bill had the enthusiastic support of employers. It was backed by conservative legislators as well as by some with liberal reputations including Hubert Humphrey.  Caption 2:  Among trade unions there was widespread opposition to the Brownell bill. The Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen called it ""Hitlerism."" Both the AFL and the CIO, not yet merged, opposed the bill and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers saw the bill as ""weapons of a police state."" Despite this, the bill was passed by Congress and signed by Eisenhower. Laying the groundwork for the enforcement of the new law, employers were firing union members who fought government control.  Caption 3:  The General Electric Co. fired some 20 workers, members of UE, the IUE and AFL craft unions who had incurred the enmity of the various congressional anti-labor committees including Sen. McCarthy's. Among those who lost their jobs were John Nelson, president of Local 506, Erie, Pa.

In the Senate, a resolution censuring Sen. Joe McCarthy was adopted when he started going after top officials of the Eisenhower Administration and the Army charging them with being involved in the ""communist conspiracy.""  Caption 2:  The courts began paying attention to the growing opposition to the congressional and employer assaults on the Bill of Rights. A decision of historic importance was won by the UE when the Supreme Court in 1955 overturned the 1950 contempt of Congress conviction of UE Secy.-Treas. Julius Emspak and Field Org. Tom Quinn who had been fired by Westinghouse for defying a congressional committee.  Caption 3:  Emspak had refused to give the committee names of UE members it wanted to pillory. ""I think it is my duty to protect the rights guaranteed under the constitution... This committee will corrupt those rights.""

His appeal against dismissal was upheld by the court. Justice Hugo Black criticized the government for conducting an ""espionage program over government employees"" and doubted that the President had the power to institute such a program.  Caption 2:  In a separate opinion, Justice Wm. O. Douglas condemned the use of ""faceless informers"" against government employees and employees ""who work for private firms having contracts with the government."" Douglas declared that a man's right to work was a ""precious liberty"" protected by the Bill of Rights. These opinions helped undermine the blacklist policies corporations like GE, Westinghouse, Westinghouse Airbrake had been using to try to smash the UE.  Caption 3:  Some of the leading informers used by the corporations and the politicians began to expose themselves or were exposed as frauds. One of them, who had worked for Sen. McCarthy and the Justice Dept. even wrote a book confessing that his testimony against many people, including some in UE, had been perjured, bought and paid for.

Caption 1:  The country was in one of its periodic recessions in 1955 leading the big corporations to think that they could impose their wills on working people. Especially in the electrical manufacturing industry where employers had succeeded  in splitting the workers was this so. UE Westinghouse workers all over the country struck in October of that year after refusing to accept a five year contract which provided for a three percent increase. When IUE members at Westinghouse struck there were 60,000 out.  Caption 2:  This was the first national Westinghouse strike since UE shut this company and GE down across the country in 1946. Westinghouse applied for court injunctions against the strikers and promoted back to work movements. As this failed to bring the desired results, the company was helped in its strikebreaking efforts by Atty.-Gen. Herbert Brownell who called on the Subversive Activities Control Board to investigate the union in a move to outlaw the organization through the Brownell-Butler Law.  Caption 3:  The tie-up between this Wall Street lawyer in the Justice Dept. and big business became clearer when a Westinghouse attorney argued before the Pennsylvania unemployment compensation bureau that the strikers were not entitled to compensation because of the Brownell action. Instead of weakening the strikers, this coordinated attack won them new support.

Matles, deported in an attempt to weaken the Westinghouse strikers. Caption 1:  As Westinghouse workers battled on the picket lines for an acceptable contract, in 1955-56, corporate-controlled politicians schemed to wreck the UE. Besides instituting proceedings to have the union outlawed by the Subversive Activities Control Board, Atty.-Gen. Brownell,a Wall St. lawyer, pushed a plan to cancel the citizenship of Director of Org. James J. Matles as prelude to having him deported. Matles had already been a citizen for 22 years when these proceedings began.  Caption 2:  The plot to deprive the workers in the electrical manufacturing  industry of Matles' leadership had been initiated by the notorious Wisconsin Sen. Joe McCarthy several years earlier, before the Senate censured him. Appearing before McCarthy, on his own insistence, Matles had stung the fascist-minded senator by calling him a liar to his face. ""Let's ... get this man deported,"" the enraged McCarthy roared to his aide, Roy Cohn. Three years later Brownell took the attack on Matles to court.  Caption 3:  The attacks on the UE and its leaders did not discourage the Westinghouse strikers. In February 1956, the company got a judge in Delaware County to send 26 leaders of the strike at Local 107, Essington, Pa., to jail and to fine them $22,000 plus a $5,000 fine on the local union.

Caption 1:  Merger of the Congress of Industrial Organizations and the American Federation of Labor took place in Nov., 1955. Born in 1935 as the Committee of Industrial Organization within the AFL and becoming an independent Congress of Industrial Organizations the following year, the CIO affiliates succeeded in a few years to organize millions of unorganized workers while carrying on progressive political policies which earned it the hatred of big business.  Caption 2:  Following the end of World War II, the policies of the CIO became indistinguishable from those of the older federation. Its leaders insisted that all affiliates support the politicians they supported. They accepted the cold war policies of the Administration. They cut ten unions with one million members off from the organization, and sponsored raids and splits within unions which refused to accept their dictates.  Caption 3:  The CIO leadership even joined with employers in using the Taft-Hartley law as a weapon against the UE and other unions which refused to depart from the founding, militant policies of the CIO. Under these conditions, the CIO had stopped growing and its existence as an independent federation became meaningless. Many within the merged AFL-CIO as well as others outside predicted that there now be a new upsurge of labor. It never happened.

Caption 1:  The national strike against the Westinghouse Electric Corp. ended on March 27, 1956, five months after it started. The company's attempt to wipe out working conditions developed over 19 years had failed. But the lock-out  against Local 107 members at the big Lester, Pa. plant continued over local issues. The entire labor movement in the Philadelphia area and political leaders, were among those who condemned the company. A petition signed by 444 merchants protested the company's wage cut demands as threatening their security.  Caption 2:  Ten months after the lockout started, 6,000 members of Local 107 had an agreement they could ratify. Meanwhile, Atty.-Gen. Brownell's Justice Dept. made a startling admission. In an affidavit to the federal court in New York City, the department urged haste in prosecuting denaturalization proceedings against Director of Org. Matles because he was ""probably the main guiding spirit"" of the union ""which recently conducted a long strike against Westinghouse."" It would be ""dangerous"" to permit him to continue in his position, the affidavit said.  Caption 3:  At the same time, there was growing proof that the informers being used by the Justice Dept. and various congressional committees were frauds. The Justice Dept. advised the Supreme Court in Oct. 1956 that it had doubts about the truthfulness of one of its leading stool-pigeons, Joseph Mazzei. His testimony before a Senate subcommittee had been used by the General Electric Co. as the basis for firing UE Local 506 Pres.

The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the UE in both cases. Caption 1:  UE scored decisive victories in the fight for free trade unionism in the years 1957-59. Outstanding were the defeats of the attempts to deprive Director of Organization James J. Matles of his citizenship as a step towards deporting him, and the dropping of the Justice Department's move to have the union outlawed on ""communism"" charges through the Subversive Activities Control Board, an action undertaken by the Wall Street lawyer, Herbert Brownell who was Eisenhower's attorney-general.  Caption 2:  Both cases had been launched during the 1955-56 Westinghouse strike. When Matles refused to supply the Justice Dept. with information to be used against him in the court, he was sentenced to serve a jail term on contempt charges. Witnesses called to testify against him in the denaturalization proceedings were exposed as liars under cross-examination. Appealed to the Supreme Court, the contempt conviction was thrown out as were the denaturalization proceedings.  Caption 3:  The Supreme Court found that the Justice Dept. had acted lawlessly and illegally. The first witness called to prove Brownell's communism charge against the union had been caught lying in another case. He had boasted, ""I had to decide whether to lie or steal. So I figured that a lie could always be justified and stealing couldn't."" He was shown up, also, as a depraved individual. Brownell's successor as attorney-general, William F. Rogers, in 1959 asked that the case against the UE be dropped because he had no witnesses to make a case.

Writing to the company that year to demand such a clause, Director of Organization Matles noted that 75 percent of UE's contracts already contained no-discrimination clauses.

As unemployment soared to almost 5 million, according to official figures, the UE called for government and corporate actions to provide jobs. Of the General Electric and Westinghouse companies, the union demanded the introduction of a 37.5 hour work week at 40 hours pay with a further cut to 35 hours a year later.  Caption 2:  During the year past, about 40,000 employees had been laid off at General Electric, so severe was this depression.

UE wrote all unions holding contracts with the two companies urging them to also make a shorter work week a leading issue in their negotiations. None of them did. The companies rejected the demand.  Caption 3:  The union organized a nationwide campaign among its members and in their communities for governmental action against unemployment. The union's program called for tax cuts for workers, extension of unemployment compensation for longer periods, and for a massive public works program. A UE lobby brought delegates from all over the country to Washington. As a result, Congress took steps to extend unemployment compensation.

Caption 1:  While the country was into a new round of layoffs in 1959, workers in the electrical manufacturing industry learned that the Tennessee Valley Authority had rejected bids submitted by GE and Westinghouse for turbo-generator equipment in favor of one by a British manufacturer. When UE started examining the reasons behind this development, it learned that the foreign bid was substantially lower than the American bid.  Caption 2:  Even more significant, however, was that in response to questions by the union, TVA officials charged that in several recent instances both companies had submitted bids identical to the penny. A similar situation was uncovered in transformers, insulators, circuit breakers, and other equipment. In ten instances, for example, it was found that GE bids were exactly the same as those of its alleged competitors.  Caption 3:  Eight cable companies had each bid exactly the same-$198,438.24-for TVA jobs. The company which got the order had offered one half of one percent discount for payment within 20 days. It was clear that there existed a huge conspiracy in the electrical manufacturing industry and that any attempt to reduce the situation to one of ""Buy American"" would help perpetuate the crime against consumers and workers in the industry.

Caption 1:  The corporate world was shaken in 1960 by the indictment of GE, Westinghouse and Allis Chalmers, some of their top officials, and a number of smaller companies for having fixed prices among themselves in order to control the $400 million-a-year turbine-generator industry. It was the biggest anti-trust case in U.S. history. The companies were accused of agreeing among themselves which of them would submit the low bid on a job.  Caption 2:  Before the indictments were brought by the government, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) had awarded a big turbo-generator job to a British firm because its bid was much lower than one submitted by GE in agreement with the other participants in this scheme. When the companies complained that foreign firms were being favored over domestic manufacturers, TVA revealed how much lower the foreign bids had been for a number of years.  Caption 3:  A congressional investigation uncovered the scheme which had been costing the consumers of electricity huge sums of money by raising the cost of power-producing equipment. Besides TVA, all the public utility companies and municipal power systems had been victimized. By making it more costly to produce electricity, and driving orders overseas, this scheme had cost UE members jobs. The UE played an important part in exposing the full meaning of these practices.

Caption 1:  One day in November, 1960, 80 corporation lawyers jammed a federal court room in Philadelphia to plead guilty to price fixing charges on behalf of more than 20 electrical manufacturing corporations and 44 of their executives. The government had shown that equipment sales amounting to nearly $2 billion a year had been manipulated by these corporations to the detriment of the country, their employees and all who used electricity.  Caption 2:  The conspirators operated under code words, met in places with names like ""Dirty Helen's,"" a Milwaukee saloon, and assigned each other orders for electrical equipment according to the ""phases of the moon."" The government charged that GE and Westinghouse bids on Tennessee Valley Authority generating equipment were written to give them a profit of 265 percent. When TVA, as a consequence, accepted a much lower British bid, American workers lost a million man hours of work.  Caption 3:  The chief attorney for Westinghouse was former U.S. Atty.-General Herbert Brownell, Jr. It was he, who, while in Eisenhower's cabinet, began denaturalization proceedings against UE Director of Org. Matles in the midst of the union's 1955-56 strike against Westinghouse and proceedings to deprive the UE of all collective bargaining rights.

Caption 1:  Among those who pleaded guilty of violating the anti-trust laws in the electrical equipment case was Fred Loock, president of Allen-Bradley. Loock said of the price-fixing cases, ""It is the only way a business can be run. It is free enterprise."" He received a suspended sentence because of his wife's illness. Three GE and two Westinghouse executives received 30 day sentences while several others were given suspended sentences.  Caption 2:  Total fines imposed on 45 corporation executives came to $137,500 and the guilty corporations were fined $1,787,000 in 1961. Soon, institutions and public utilities which had been victims of the monopoly-controlled electrical equipment prices sued the manufacturers for damages running into the scores of millions. These suits were settled out of court.  Caption 3:  Later, the Internal Revenue Service accepted the convicted corporations' claim that the cost of the damage suits could be deducted as a business expense. Meanwhile, TVA reported that for the first time in years, GE and Westinghouse bids had fallen below European bids. The UE pointed out that not the high cost of workers' wages had cost American firms their competitive advantage over foreign manufacturers, but their own monopoly profiteering.

Caption 1:  Though only two years had passed since the last sharp employment drop, unemployment rose to its highest in 19 months in the Spring of 1963. President Kennedy described the situation as especially critical for young people. With expected increases in the number of young people in the years ahead, the need for a shorter work week became increasingly urgent. Unemployment averaged 5.5 percent over the five previous years.  Caption 2:  This was the year when the demand for equality for black people became ever more insistent. Some 200,000 people, black and white, marched on Washington on Aug. 28 to demand equal rights for all. It was the largest demonstration ever seen in the capital. Large numbers of trade unionists participated stressing demands for equality of employment and calling on Congress to adopt civil rights legislation.  Caption 3:  It was here that the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., made his moving speech saying that he had a dream that one day ""this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed...that all men are created free and equal,"" that one day his children will live in a nation ""where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.""

Caption 1:  The civil rights struggles of the 1960s had their effect on Congress. After months of debate and filibuster, Congress in 1964 approved a bill prohibiting application of different  standards to black and white registrants in interpreting literacy tests for voting. The bill banned discrimination in the use of public facilities as well as in employment. It established a civil rights commission to supervise the enforcement of the legislation.  Caption 2:  Alongside the movement for this legislation there continued the drive for the rights of all Americans to vote on an equal basis. The urgency of this drive was exemplified by the situation in Mississippi where fewer than 7 percent of the black population of voting age were registered, 20,000 blacks as compared to 500,000 whites. Denied representation by the official Democratic Party, supporters of civil rights in that state formed the Freedom Democratic Party.  Caption 3:  The Freedom Democratic Party carried on a registration drive among black citizens and prepared to send delegates to the 1964 national Democratic convention hoping to replace the official Mississippi delegation. The nation was shocked when three young men, one black and two white, who were involved in the Mississippi registration drive were kidnapped and murdered. It soon became evident that local authorities had conspired to commit this brutal act.

Caption 1:  Having fought Japanese invaders in World War II and then defeating the French government's attempt to resume colonial rule of their country, the people of Vietnam looked forward to independence as the second half of the 20th century began. The defeat of France was recognized in a peace treaty which set a schedule for national Vietnamese elections which would unite northern and southern Vietnam.  Caption 2:  Those elections never took place. Vietnamese landlords who feared that the peasants would occupy their lands and native militarists who had enjoyed French favors begana a rebellion and moved to make permanent the temporary division of the country. President Eisenhower had rejected the proposal of his secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, that the U.S. intervene on the side of the French but then President Kennedy sent a few hundred ""advisers"" to help the south.  Caption 3:  When President Lyndon Johnson, who had succeeded the assassinated Kennedy in 1963, ran for the Presidency the next year he denounced his Republican opponent, Sen. Barry Goldwater, for planning to send American boys to fight in Vietnam and for proposing massive U.S. bombing  of that country on behalf of the southern militarists. Johnson's pledge to steer clear of the war was a major factor in his overwhelming victory. A few months later, however, he began sending hundreds of thousands of troops to Asia.

Caption 1:  Four months after he was elected on a pledge not to send American boys to fight in an Asian war, President Johnson began pouring combat troops into South Vietnam to fight the native guerrilla forces. First it was 3,500 marines to protect an air base. Then it was army troops to ""protect"" the villagers from the guerillas. Every shipment of troops was accompanied by a Pentagon declaration that just a few more contingents would bring the war to an end.  Caption 2:  As U.S. intervention increased, the UE at its 1964 convention declared that, ""The effort to impose, by military means, an American solution to an Asian political problem, estranges the United States from the peoples and governments of Asia, and finds no real support among even our country's closest allies."" College campuses were swept by protest demonstrations as young people demanded an end to the war, an end to the U.S. bombing of villages.  Caption 3:  In South Vietnam, itself, the government had become so unpopular and the war so burdensome that Buddhist priests set themselves afire in public protests. U.S. troops were used to suppress the growing religious opposition to the war. Trying to explain why American planes were used to destroy a village, an American military adviser said, ""We had to destroy it in order to save it.""

Caption 1:  Opposition to the Vietnam war grew as it stretched into the longest war in U.S. history and the casualty lists climbed. By mid-1967, the U.S. had suffered over 100,000 dead and wounded and there was no end in sight. Young people, those who were expected to do the fighting, were the first to speak out in an organized way. A 1965 March on Washington to End the War brought 25,000 young people to the capital. Administration spokesmen condemned them.  Caption 2:  Gradually, trade unions began to speak out against the war citing not only the casualties, American and Asian, but also the harmful effect the huge military expenditures were having on the economy. While the leadership of the AFL-CIO was giving unwavering support to the war, increasing numbers of rank and filers, local unions and leaders of some international unions, AFL-CIO affiliates and unaffiliated demanded an end to the war.  Caption 3:  The labor opposition was expressed in a Labor Leadership Assembly for Peace in Chicago in Nov. 1967 where over 500 trade unionists declared that labor ""must play its part in bringing this savage war to a swift and just conclusion.""

Congress had voted the largest military budget in U.S. history, even surpassing World War II-$69.9 billion. For the ""model cities"" program which the President had pronounced as a basic pillar of his administration's policies, there was only $312 million. War on Vietnam's cities had replaced war on poverty at home.  Caption 2:  The military budget was laying the basis for the runaway inflation which was to persist into the 1970s. Corporate profits soared along with the war's casualty lists.As inflation pushed the cost of living up, the President called on labor to exercise ""wage restraints"" and proposed higher taxes to deprive workers of even more purchasing power in order to pay for the increasingly unpopular war.

Caption 1:  Fourteen years after it had adopted a policy of discharging any worker who relied on the Bill of Rights to protect him from persecution by congressional committees, the General Electric Co. informed the UE in December 1967 that it had dropped that policy. This after repeated demands by the union since 1953 that it do so had gone unheeded. Twenty-eight long-service employees, members of UE and other unions, had been fired under this policy including Local 506 Pres. John Nelson.  Caption 2:  UE Pres. Fitzgerald called on GE to amend the injustice  it had done those employees, not only destroying their livelihoods but also doing irreparable damage to them and their families in the communities in which they lived. The plea was ignored. The Cordiner policy, named after the GE president of the time, had played a major role in discouraging militant worker activity, in splitting the union and in weakening labor political action.  Caption 3:  Almost at the same time as the union learned of the GE revocation of its unconstitutional policy, the Supreme Court, in December 1967, threw out the provisions of the Subversive Activities Control Act which made it a crime for a communist to work in a defense plant.

Caption 1:  In 1964, Lyndon Johnson was elected President with the largest plurality any candidate for that office had ever received. His victory over Republican Barry Goldwater was based on the pledge that he would not extend American intervention in Vietnam while the Republican candidate called for even greater participation by U.S. forces. Johnson betrayed that pledge and hundreds of thousands of Americans were shipped into Indochina.  Caption 2:  Opposition to the war and to Johnson's refusal to end U.S. intervention grew so intense that by 1968 the President fearing defeat, decided against running for re-election. This time it was the Republican candidate, Richard Nixon, who promised to bring the war to an end while his opponent, Sen. Hubert Humphrey clung to the Johnson record. Nixon won but  gain the voters soon found that they had been tricked. Nixon secretly spread the war into Cambodia.  Caption 3:  This new betrayal raised the protests against the war to new heights. In June 1972, 985 representatives of trade unions met in St. Louis to protest the war and to plan their campaign against it.

The huge cost of the war had brought on the worst unemployment in nearly half a century and the highest inflation ever. In order to suppress opposition to the war, government agencies had waged a war against the constitutional rights of the American people through the FBI, CIA and other agencies.  Caption 2:  Then came the Watergate incident in which the Nixon Administration directed the looting of the Democratic Party headquarters in an attempt to find proof that that party's Presidential candidate was a tool of the Cuban government. With the probing of that incident the American people began learning to what lengths their leaders had gone to undermine basic freedoms in the name of opposing communism.  Caption 3:  Further investigation had shown that using the same excuse, U.S. agencies had plotted the assassination of foreign government heads; had helped overthrow the democratic government in Chile and replace it with an anti-labor military dictatorship; that American corporations had bribed foreign government officials; that American legislators were bribed by heads of U.S.-favored foreign dictatorships.

Caption 1:  The end of the Vietnam war left the economy deep in inflation and unemployment. When the great depression of the 1930's hit the country, there sprang up a powerful protest movement which led to the establishment of unemployment compensation, social security, vast public works programs. There came into being, also, an industrial union movement which swept through the giant industrial monopolies such as GE, Westinghouse, U.S. Steel, Ford and General Motors.  Caption 2:  Alarmed by the growing strength of the labor movement with its strong rank-and-file influence, big business promoted laws such as the Taft-Hartley Act, congressional investigations and an extensive propaganda campaign to split the labor movement. It found people within the labor movement to help divide the trade unions. Labor was harnessed to politicians who dragged the country through repeated recessions, while the corporations grew more powerful, and then into the devastating war in Asia.  Caption 3:  In the 1970's the labor movement was faced with the need to restore the influence it had before the splits of the 1950's had made it ineffective politically and far weaker organizationally. The persistent mass unemployment, the multinational corporations moving jobs abroad, the problems of pollution, energy crisis and the arms program sapping the nations' wealth presented labor with a challenge it would have to meet for its own welfare and the country as a whole.
